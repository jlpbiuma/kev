# Kev-4B

Kev-4B is a **decision model**: one document (the *state*) and a set of typed questions in, a probability distribution per question out, in one forward pass. No text generation. It is a LoRA adapter (r=16, 33.8M trainable parameters) plus a pointer head on `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B-Base` (revision `1001bb4d`), serving TypeSafe's public `/v1/systemone` contract.

**This version (2026-09-24): real-document delta.** The previous Kev-4B plus one epoch (lr 2e-5) on `documents-v1` train: 5,219 real US consumer-finance complaint narratives (CFPB, 2015-2024, up to ~7k tokens) with 7,488 questions (which product, which main issue), labels kept only where two open-weight teachers agreed with the consumer's own filing, mixed with 2,000 replayed `decision-v7` records. On complaint narratives it has never seen, accuracy goes from 0.804 to **0.904** on the locked test (+9.9 pp [+7.5, +12.4], 936 questions) and from 0.811 to **0.891** on a private held-out set (`documents-v2`, 953 questions); on the development split it scores 0.895 against Jev's 0.868. Everything else is unchanged within noise: locked out-of-domain test 0.835 (previous 0.837), served Brier 0.233 (0.232).

**Read this before relying on the documents numbers.** The gain is measured **in distribution**: training and every documents suite share one source (CFPB complaints) and the same two question templates. It shows Kev-4B learns real long documents from a few thousand labelled examples; it does not show the same gain on other kinds of documents. Evaluation labels are AI-adjudicated (a unanimous three-model judge panel, or two agreeing adjudications) and human spot-checked (47/50 and 50/50).

- Hub: `jaredpalmer/kev-4b` (this repo; trial `r8-small/00-trial-0`; the registration and every read are in `PLAN.md` round 8 on the `research/overnight-r6` branch). The previous version is at tag `night2-du-release`; the pre-delta v7 checkpoint at `v7-base`; the Qwen3 generation at `qwen3` ([its card](kev-4b-qwen3.md)).
- Code, suites, every trial with hashes and paired bootstraps: [github.com/jaredpalmer/kev](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/kev). The numbers below are in `runs/release/kev-4b-r8.json`.

Paired against the previous version (record-clustered bootstrap, 95 %): documents dev +8.4 pp [+6.0, +10.6], locked test +9.9 [+7.5, +12.4], private held-out +8.0 [+5.6, +10.3]; scienthoon +2.6 [+0.8, +4.4]; SemIf −0.7 [−2.8, +1.4]; WANLI-v2 −0.8 [−2.0, +0.4]; TypeSafe identical on all 89 rows. The release was decided by a rule registered before any read (`PLAN.md` round 8, `research/overnight-r6` branch): documents development lower bound > 0, short-state and external guards sized to what each suite can resolve, then one read of the untouched documents test and one locked read. A first seed (round 7) gave the same documents gain and failed only per-suite lower bounds on the two smallest suites; it was not released.

**Calibration.** The delta sharpened the raw logits (fitted temperature 2.14 → 2.96; raw out-of-domain Brier 0.327, raw locked Brier 0.278). As served, calibration is unchanged. `KEV_TEMPERATURE=1.0` gives the raw values.

## Previous version: `night2-du` (2026-09-21), kept at tag `night2-du-release`

**At its release, the recommended Kev.** The best accuracy per byte: out of domain 0.797 on the development partition and **0.837 on the locked test**, Brier 0.255 on the test, held-out rule pairs 0.77–0.78. This checkpoint is the `decision-v7` recipe (trial `q35-4b-s23/00-trial-0`, seed 2, selected on development accuracy) followed by a 9-minute **delta fine-tune** (`--init_from`, lr 2e-5, one epoch) on 1,425 additional records — date-bearing policy cases rendered with explicit day counts, and evidence-free cases with uniform targets — mixed with 2,000 replayed training records. Against the pre-delta checkpoint on the locked test: +1.0 pp [−0.1, +2.1], Brier 0.266 → 0.255, `deadline` 0.65 → 0.75.


| | Kev-4B (Qwen3) | Kev-4B before the delta (`v7-base`) | **Kev-4B, raw logits** | **Kev-4B as served (T = 2.14)** | Jev |

| held-out policy structures, both siblings correct | 0.73 | 0.78 | 0.78 | 0.78 | 0.86 |
| unknowable items answered at ≥ 0.9 (lower is better; transfer-v9) | 0.44 | 0.19 | **0.00** | 0.00 | 0.09 |
| **locked test**, out-of-domain accuracy / Brier | 0.806 / 0.294 | 0.832 / 0.266 | **0.837 / 0.255** | – | – |
| **locked test**, in-distribution accuracy | 0.856 | 0.870 | 0.871 | – | – |

Per-source out-of-domain accuracy (Kev-4B / Jev): QNLI 0.91 / 0.93, SciQ 0.97 / 0.99, TweetEval-offensive 0.74 / 0.81, PAWS 0.74 / 0.79, MMLU 0.70 / 0.90, Emotion 0.56 / 0.59, deadline (3-level date arithmetic) 0.60 / 0.93 — **0.85 with the `date_facts` preprocessor** (below), (A or B) and C 0.91 / 0.91, (A and B) or not C 0.88 / 0.97, if A then not B else C 1.00 / 0.78.

**Calibration is built in.** `head.pt` carries a temperature (T = 2.14) fitted on this checkpoint's in-distribution development rows by minimising negative log-likelihood ([`scripts/calibrate_checkpoint.py`](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/kev/blob/main/scripts/calibrate_checkpoint.py)); the pointer head divides its logits by it at inference. Every loader — `kev.serve`, `kev.benchmark`, the Space, anyone's harness — gets the calibrated probabilities by default. It never changes an answer: the argmax is identical, so accuracy is the same in both columns; confidences are re-ordered only slightly across questions with different option counts, which is why coverage moves by a point or two. `KEV_TEMPERATURE=1.0` restores the raw logits; the raw column is what the training produced. Per-(type, option-count) temperatures were tested and are worse out of domain. The fit uses no out-of-domain or test data.

**`date_facts` preprocessor.** Kev, like every Kev before it, cannot subtract dates reliably (the untrained base can; LoRA training erodes it). It can use a stated day count. `KEV_DATE_FACTS=1` appends one sentence per pair of absolute dates found in the state ("June 26, 2026 is 8 days before July 4, 2026"); this checkpoint was trained on such renderings, so with it `deadline` goes from 0.60 to 0.85 and overall out-of-domain accuracy from 0.797 to 0.820. It is preprocessing, reported separately, never folded into the model's own numbers.

**What the delta cost.** MMLU-Pro fell 0.500 → 0.490 and scienthoon's ECE rose 0.086 → 0.116; coverage at ≤ 5% error was unchanged (0.54 development, 0.67 → 0.68 locked test) and confident errors fell (8.2% → 6.9%). The pre-registered criteria for the delta (`PLAN.md`, "Tonight's autoresearch") were met for dates and for the unknowable-confidence behaviour; the coverage criterion asked for +5 pp and got 0; the locked read decided promotion.

**Newer evaluation columns** (`transfer-v9` development, Kev-4B / Jev): MMLU-Pro (10-way) 0.490 / 0.840; state buried among unrelated records 0.67 / 0.70; unknowable share at ≥ 0.9 confidence 0.00 / 0.09 (intact controls 0.94).

**External suites** (same items as their published Jev numbers): SemIf's authored 144 — 0.896 before the delta (live Jev 0.965; SemIf's untrained Qwen3.5-4B 0.813); scienthoon's 900 tickets — queue 0.918, angry 0.790, ECE 0.116 (Jev 0.897, 0.914, 0.105). On ekzhang's 1,000-question MMLU-Pro sample the shipped checkpoint scores 0.468 over all 1,000 questions (8 exceed the state limit and count as wrong; live Jev 0.835 on the same items, ekzhang reports 0.829). On SemIf's pinned third-party selections (`evals/external/{wanli,typesafe}-v1`): WANLI-256 accuracy 0.695 (live Jev 0.758); TypeSafe-102 equal-case agreement / total-variation distance 0.856 / 0.231 over the 89 rows within the 8,192-token serving context (13 rejected), 0.770 / 0.308 over all 102 with rejected rows scored as wrong (live Jev 0.891 / 0.125; published TypeSafe answers 0.883 / 0.127); plain accuracy on the answered rows 0.843, coverage at <= 5% error 0.02 (Jev 0.892, 0.84). The shipped temperature is fitted in distribution and does not transfer to every workload. On WANLI, a single temperature fitted on the workload's own labelled rows (`python -m kev.calibrate`, group-disjoint out-of-fold) lowers ECE from 0.166 as shipped to 0.052 (workload T 3.91 against the shipped 2.14). Accuracy is unchanged and coverage at <= 5% error does not improve. On TypeSafe the shipped temperature already fits and refitting does not help (ECE 0.158 as shipped, 0.175 out of fold).

### How it was built

- **Base model**: Qwen3.5-4B-Base, a hybrid of 24 Gated DeltaNet (linear attention) layers and 8 full-attention layers. Because the recurrent layers cannot honour a block-causal mask, questions run as separate causal rows that continue from the shared state (`kev/model.py: forward_rows_batch`); isolation is exact by construction (together vs alone within 1e-5) and on attention-only models this form is bit-identical to the packed one.
- **Recipe**: `decision-v7`, two epochs, LoRA r=16 (attention, MLP and DeltaNet projections), lr 5e-5 — the same data and settings as every other Kev, so the Qwen3 → Qwen3.5 difference is the base (`PLAN.md`, Qwen3.5 port §10: locked test +7.3 pp [+2.8, +11.7] over Kev-8B).
- **Delta**: `kev.train --init_from jaredpalmer/kev-4b@v7-base --data evals/night2/dates_unknowable.jsonl --replay 2000 --lr 2e-5 --epochs 1`. The 1,425 new records are generated (no public dataset): 900 date-bearing policy cases, a third rendered plainly, a third with a relational day-count sentence, a third with a `date_facts` field; 255 cases with the deciding sentence removed and a uniform soft target over the options, plus their 270 intact controls. Record hashes are in `evals/night2/manifest.json`; the source checkpoint's hashes are in `training_config.json`.
- Why a delta and not a retrain: it is a controlled change (one fixed checkpoint, one data addition, 9 minutes), and the results section shows exactly what it moved.

### Known limits

- Use [Kev-9B](kev-9b.md) when accuracy and calibration matter more than memory: 0.852 vs 0.837 out of domain on the locked test, Brier 0.237 vs 0.255.

- **Slow on a Mac.** The DeltaNet kernels have no MPS implementation; PyTorch falls back to reference code. A five-question request that takes 0.17 s on the Qwen3 Kev-4B takes 0.78 s here in bf16 on an M5. On CUDA with `flash-linear-attention` installed it is fast. Use `jaredpalmer/kev-4b@qwen3` for low latency on Apple Silicon until an MLX path exists.
- Requires `transformers >= 5.17` (the `qwen3_5` architecture) and `peft >= 0.21`.
- Knowledge (MMLU 0.70 vs Jev 0.90; MMLU-Pro 0.490 vs 0.840), TweetEval (0.74 vs 0.81) and noisy-label Emotion (0.56 vs 0.59) are the remaining gap; knowledge is set by the base (the untrained Qwen3.5-4B scores the same).
- Date arithmetic without the preprocessor: `deadline` 0.60 (Jev 0.93). With `KEV_DATE_FACTS=1`: 0.85.
- The raw logits are over-confident out of domain; the built-in temperature (T = 2.14) fixes most of it without changing any answer. `KEV_TEMPERATURE=1.0` gives the raw values. Coverage at a 5% error budget is 0.54–0.68 against Jev's 0.70.
- 4B bf16 needs ~9 GB of GPU memory for serving; training took 56 min on one H100 (peak 24.6 GB).

### Training

Frozen suite `evals/v7/decision-v7`: 10,000 public records (1,000 per source), 896 policy minimal-pair records over nine template families, 1,680 records from 60 randomly generated rule structures in four rendering styles. Two epochs, LoRA r=16 α=32 on `q/k/v/o_proj`, `gate/up/down_proj`, `in_proj_qkv/z/a/b`, `out_proj`; pointer head from scratch; cross-entropy on the option distribution; lr 5e-5 (OneCycle), effective batch 8, bf16 autocast with fp32 master weights, gradient checkpointing; option permutation, none-of-the-above insertion, distractors, none minimal pairs on 25% of Choice records. Then the delta described above (one epoch, lr 2e-5, 3,937 records seen, 9 minutes on one H100). No Jev outputs were used for training.

### Evaluation protocol

Development partitions select models; the locked test partition is read at most once per candidate (`runs/locked/kev-4b-night2-du-ungated/`; the pre-delta read is `runs/locked/kev-4b-q35/`). Every number carries suite hash, code hashes and git commit in `result.json`. Untrained-base baselines use zero-shot letter logits on the same items (`scripts/base_mmlu_probe.py`).

## Use

```bash
uv run --extra serve python -m kev.serve --run jaredpalmer/kev-4b --port 8008      # KEV_DTYPE=bf16 on a Mac; slow on MPS, see limits
KEV_DATE_FACTS=1 uv run --extra serve python -m kev.serve --run jaredpalmer/kev-4b --port 8008   # + date preprocessing; KEV_TEMPERATURE=1.0 for raw logits
