# Research plan

This file is the living plan: where Kev stands, what runs next and the criteria decided before the runs, and open questions. Completed plans stay as records under **History** (the Qwen3.5 port, done 2026-09-20, is [there](#qwen35-port-2026-09-20)). The active round is **Round 4** below (current-architecture levers, registered 2026-09-22); the proposal after it is [`PLAN_27b.md`](PLAN_27b.md) (Qwen3.8-27B, question-side LoRA, long documents), gated on round 4's items 4.8 and 4.12. Everything older is kept below under **History**, dated.

## Where we stand (2026-09-22)

- **Family:** Kev-0.8B / 4B / 9B on Qwen3.5 bases, one recipe (`decision-v7`, LoRA r=16, lr 1e-4 / 5e-5 / 5e-5) plus the 2026-09-21 dates + unknowable delta. Locked test, out of domain: 0.684 / 0.837 / **0.852**; Jev 0.857 on the development items. Pre-delta weights at Hub tag `v7-base`; Qwen3 checkpoints published as the previous generation.
- **Gap to Jev (pre-delta Kev-9B, `transfer-v4` dev, 4.5 pp overall; 3.5 pp after the delta):** knowledge (MMLU 0.74 vs 0.90; MMLU-Pro 0.545 vs 0.84) — the untrained base scores the same, so this is base capacity; date arithmetic (`deadline` 0.72 vs 0.93) — any LoRA fine-tune on our format erodes the base's skill (0.82 → 0.72), while the readout is intact (giving the model the day count yields 0.93–1.0, issue #8); calibration — Brier 0.291 vs 0.211, **coverage at ≤ 5 % error 0.53 vs 0.70**, confident errors 7.5 % vs 3.7 %; robustness — assertion-style Noul instructions ("The customer sounds angry.") drove Kev-4B to 0.79 vs Jev 0.91 on scienthoon's tickets.
- **Tools now available:** `--init_from` delta fine-tunes from a released checkpoint (minutes, not hours); `--data` JSONL for custom records; `transfer-v9` (MMLU-Pro, buried, unknowable) and the SemIf / scienthoon external suites; coverage-at-error-budget and unknowable metrics in `kev.benchmark`.
- **Budget:** Modal metered **$405.94** on 2026-09-22 (round-3 registration read $392.14); authorization $1,000 total, of which round 4 below may use $60 before a fresh billing check.

## Round 4 — current-architecture levers before the 27B (registered 2026-09-22)

**Why this round exists.** Two external data points (analysis of [SemIf](https://github.com/theoleecj/semif) and [Solomon](https://huggingface.co/DoccyHealth/Solomon), 2026-09-22) moved the priorities: zero-shot Qwen3.8-27B beats *trained* Kev-4B on SemIf's authored suite (0.958 balanced vs 0.847), so base capacity is now the main lever for external numbers — but Kev's shipped temperature does not transfer to WANLI (Kev-9B ECE 0.131, 21/132 errors at p ≥ 0.9, [`runs/kev-9b-wanli-v1`](runs/kev-9b-wanli-v1/report.json)) while SemIf's per-workload T fixed a comparable ECE (0.21 → 0.07) without training. Every item below is cheap at the current sizes, and any recipe finding transfers to the 27B run at a hundredth of its cost. **Nothing that landed between the night-2 sign-off (`4f8110a`) and this registration changes training**: the refactors were bit-identical (PRs #18, #21), the three loss flags default to 0, the temperature is eval-only — so no retrain of 0.8B / 4B / 9B is needed on that account.

Already tried with negative results, not repeated: loss modifiers (round 3), per-group temperatures (round 2 #2a), DeltaNet-frozen LoRA (#5), the assertion delta alone (#4), 35B-A3B (#1/#8).

**Tier 0 — no training.** Reporting changes need no gate; each option below has one.

| # | item | run | adopt if (pre-registered) | cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | **Per-workload calibration path.** `kev.calibrate --rows <rows.json>`: restore raw logits (rows record `inference_temperature`), fit one T with group-disjoint OOF folds, print raw / shipped-T / OOF-T rows with bootstrap CIs. Commit `rows.json` for the external runs so anyone can refit. | local, $0 | Reporting. Cards gain a "calibrated to this workload (OOF)" row for WANLI and TypeSafe next to the raw row. | $0 |
| 4.2 | **`KEV_DATE_FACTS` as serving default.** Evidence: dev 0.797 → 0.820 (4B), 0.822 → 0.828 (9B), no harm observed on `transfer-v4` (round 3, H1). Unknown on external states. | one `benchmarks` pass: 9B + 4B with `--date_facts` on semif-v1, scienthoon-v1, wanli-v1, typesafe-v1 | Flip the default (opt-out `KEV_DATE_FACTS=0`) only if no external suite drops by more than 0.5 pp accuracy and no confident-error rate rises by more than 0.5 pp; otherwise stays opt-in and the negative is recorded. Benchmark headline rows stay raw either way. | ~$3 |
| 4.3 | **Paired-CI incumbent rule** in `kev.autoresearch`. Today `incumbent()`/`score()` pick by the transfer point estimate; with one seed and ~650 questions that chases noise. | code, $0 | A challenger replaces the incumbent only if its record-clustered paired bootstrap on transfer accuracy has lower bound ≥ −1 pp **and** point estimate above the incumbent; the CI is written to `leaderboard.jsonl`. No new training. | $0 |
| 4.4 | **Rotation-averaged Choice** at test time: score every cyclic rotation of the options, log-mean the option probabilities. Kev's pointer head is content-addressed, so this should do little; `permutation.mean_max_delta` says it is not zero. | `benchmark --rotations`, 9B + 4B on `transfer-v4` dev | Becomes a serving option (never default) if transfer accuracy improves ≥ +0.5 pp with a paired CI lower bound ≥ 0 or the permutation flip rate halves; otherwise recorded as evidence the design already handles order. | ~$2 |
| 4.5 | **Two-checkpoint averaging** (round-3 C6, never run): mean probabilities of the two v7 seeds per size (9B s0/s1, 4B s2/s3, 0.8B three seeds) from saved `transfer/rows.json`. | local, $0 | Informational unless coverage at ≤ 5 % error improves ≥ +5 pp or Brier improves with a paired CI excluding zero; then a second `du` seed (~$2) and a serving option that doubles cost. | $0 |
| 4.6 | **bf16 / MLX flip rate at scale.** The parity claim rests on 40 records. | `scripts/mlx_parity.py` on the full development partition, 4B + 0.8B (Mac) | Reporting: flip rate and max Δp published in the cards. | $0 |
| 4.7 | Re-run `scripts/calibrate_checkpoint.py` on Kev-9B and Kev-0.8B so `head.pt["temperature_fit"]["cross_validation"]` exists for all three (same T; audit field only). Republish `head.pt` only. | local, $0 | Reporting. | $0 |

**Tier 1 — training, deltas or single trials, each attacking a measured gap.** Selection on development partitions only; one locked read per adopted candidate; paired, record-clustered bootstraps throughout ([`kev.metrics.paired_bootstrap`](kev/metrics.py)).

| # | question | run | adopt if (pre-registered) | cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.8 | **Does a post-trained dense 9B keep its date arithmetic through Kev training?** Open question since night 2: every Base checkpoint erodes `deadline` (0.82 → 0.72 at 9B), the post-trained 35B-A3B kept it (0.88 → 0.95). `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B` (pinned `c202236235762e1c871ad0ccb60c8ee5ba337b9a`, same hybrid layout as the Base) has never been probed. | (a) zero-shot probe, plain + SemIf prompt, `transfer-v4` + `transfer-v9`; (b) one v7-recipe trial, lr 5e-5, seed 0; (c) if (b) passes, the dates + unknowable delta on top. | Probe gate for (b): plain or SemIf zero-shot ≥ 0.73 on `transfer-v4` dev (the Base scored 0.729) — a post-trained base that reads the format worse is not worth a trial. Candidate gate for (c) and a locked read: `deadline` raw ≥ 0.85 (Kev-9B-du raw 0.80), transfer dev within 1 pp of 0.822 or above, MMLU not lower by more than 1 pp, coverage at ≤ 5 % error not lower by more than 3 pp, held-out pairs ≥ 0.75. Promotion needs the locked read ≥ 0.852 − 1 pp with no external suite worse by more than 1 pp. The card must say the base is post-trained. | probe ~$4, trial ~$7, delta ~$2 |
| 4.9 | **Ambiguity soft targets (round-3 C5, never run).** 16 of Kev-9B's 26 confident transfer errors are PAWS; 59 % of all errors sit on the three noisy-label sources. Where an open teacher disagrees with the public label at ≥ 0.6, train toward a label/teacher mixture instead of the hard label — the `materialize` soft-target mechanism the unknowable records already use. Teacher: the untrained post-trained Qwen3.5-9B (SemIf prompt) or the 4B one already scored (`runs/probes/qwen35-4b-semif-transfer-v4`); **never Jev.** | teacher pass over the `decision-v7` training partition's public rows (~$3); two deltas (9B, 4B) from the released checkpoints, replay 2000, lr 2e-5, 1 epoch; T re-fitted on each trial's own dev rows | Coverage at ≤ 5 % error on `transfer-v4` dev (served probabilities) ≥ +5 pp over the released checkpoint with accuracy within 1 pp (paired CI lower bound ≥ −1 pp), AURC no worse, unknowable share ≥ 0.9 on `transfer-v9` ≤ 0.05. Report every trial regardless. | ~$8 |
| 4.10 | **Reliability head** on the unused 968-record `decision-v7/calibration` partition: logistic on (p_max, margin, entropy, K, type) re-ranking confidences. Solomon shipped and then dropped one; a genuine experiment. | fit locally on saved rows; evaluate OOF on `transfer-v4` dev + WANLI | AURC or coverage at ≤ 5 % error improves with a paired CI excluding zero on **both** evaluation sets; otherwise recorded negative. | $0 |
| 4.11 | **Self-distillation 9B → 0.8B**: Kev-9B's served probabilities as soft targets for a 0.8B delta on the same training partition (our own outputs; the no-Jev rule is untouched). | one delta ~$1.50 | Transfer dev ≥ +2 pp over Kev-0.8B-du (0.643 seed) with paired CI lower bound > 0 and coverage not lower; then one locked read. | ~$2 |
| 4.12 | **Long-state delta at 4B** (de-risks [`PLAN_27b.md`](PLAN_27b.md) B2 before any document set exists): the `buried` generator at 1k / 2k / 4k-token states, `MAX_STATE` lifted for the delta, short-state suites re-scored. | one delta ~$3 | Informational: report the short-state cost (transfer within 1 pp is the hope) and the long-state gain. Anything beyond this belongs to the 27B plan. | ~$3 |

**Order and stop rules.** 4.1 → 4.3 → 4.7 → 4.2 + 4.4 (one Modal pass) → 4.5 + 4.6 → 4.8(a) → 4.8(b) → 4.9 → 4.10 → 4.11 → 4.12. Total bound ≈ $35 plus probes; fresh `modal billing summary` before 4.8(b) and before 4.9. If 4.8 produces a candidate, *that* is the retrain — one size, one trial, one locked read — not a from-scratch family run. The 27B plan waits for 4.8 and 4.12: a post-trained 9B that holds its arithmetic changes which 27B to pin and drops the question-side-LoRA ablation in priority; the long-state cost sizes B2. Every result, met or not, is written below this section with its run directory.

## Round 5 — long states + soft targets as a release candidate (registered 2026-09-22, before any training or read)

**Budget.** Modal now sponsors the project: $5,000 in credits, more on request. That removes the round-4 $60 envelope; the rules below are unchanged by it. We use H200s for the long-state trials (6k-token rows at 9B).

**Why.** Round 4 found the largest gap we have measured: the released models lose 22–43 pp when the state is 1–4k tokens long, and a one-epoch 4B delta on buried records closed two thirds of it at 1–2k with no measurable short-state cost against the release (4.12). It also found that ambiguity soft targets are the way to keep training without degrading the model (#65: against a matched hard-label delta, Brier −0.011, accuracy +1.1 pp on fresh data). This round combines the two, adds more 4k and new 6k records (4k stayed weak with 600 examples), and asks whether that is a release at each size.

**Data** (all frozen before training; large files regenerated by the builders, sha256 in each manifest):
- `evals/round5/longstate-v2/train.jsonl`: 2,800 decision-v7/train primaries buried to ~1k / 2k / 4k / 6k tokens (400 / 400 / 1,000 / 1,000; `scripts/build_long_states.py`, seed `round5-longstate-v2`).
- `evals/round5/combined-v1/soft.jsonl` = long-state records + `evals/round4/ambiguity-v1/soft.jsonl`; `hard.jsonl` = the same with the ambiguity questions' hard labels (the matched control).
- **Long-state panel** `evals/round5/longstate-v2/development.jsonl`: 480 buried records, 120 per length (591 questions; the count was written as "480 questions" at registration and corrected after the read — the rule is applied per question either way) from decision-v7's **calibration** partition plus the same primaries unburied. Those records were scored raw inside every trial to fit its internal temperature but never used to select a model, and no model has seen them buried.
- **Short-state panel** `evals/round5/transfer-r5/test.jsonl`: 1,260 records frozen with `scripts/freeze_calibration_audit.py --tag r5 --panel_only` (seed 2026092205, sha256 `466e73e8…`), disjoint from every state under `evals/` (the builder's reservation check: 0 overlap). The round-3 panel is spent.

**Arms** (one-epoch deltas from the released checkpoint, lr 2e-5 (0.8B: 4e-5), 2,000 replay records, `--max_state 7552`, bf16, H200; seed 1 unless stated):

| arm | size | data | role |
|---|---|---|---|
| C9 | 9B | combined soft | **candidate** |
| C9-s2 | 9B | combined soft, seed 2 | seed variance; reported, never selected |
| H9 | 9B | combined hard | attribution: soft targets on long-state training |
| C4 | 4B | combined soft | **candidate** |
| H4 | 4B | combined hard | attribution |
| C08 | 0.8B | combined soft | **candidate** |

The existing soft-only 9B delta (`r4-soft/00-trial-0`, same seed and replay sample) is the long-state attribution arm for 9B.

**Rule, per size, candidate minus the released checkpoint of that size** (each served at a temperature fitted on its own decision-v7 development rows, `kev.metrics.served`; paired record-clustered bootstrap, micro, 2,000 resamples, seed 0):
1. **Long states (primary):** accuracy on the buried questions of the long-state panel, lower 95 % bound > 0 **and** point estimate ≥ +5 pp.
2. **Short states (guard) on transfer-r5 test:** accuracy lower bound ≥ −1 pp; Brier upper bound ≤ +0.01; confident-error rate upper bound ≤ +1 pp.
3. **Secondary** (point estimates): `transfer-v9` unknowable share at p ≥ 0.9 ≤ 0.05; SemIf, scienthoon, WANLI accuracy and TypeSafe accuracy on answered rows each ≥ −1 pp.
4. **Then one locked read per passing size** (`locked_test`, named `kev-<size>-r5`): transfer-v4 locked accuracy ≥ the parent's − 1 pp, served Brier ≤ the parent's + 0.005 on the same items.

Reported, not gating: every per-length number, C9-s2, the attribution arms, coverage / AURC / ECE, and all numbers on `longstate-v1`. **If a size passes everything:** fit its temperature into `head.pt`, publish as the new main of `jaredpalmer/kev-<size>` with the current weights tagged `night2-du` first, and update its card with raw and served numbers and this outcome. **If it fails anything:** that size is not released; results are written here; no re-read.

### Round 5 result (read once, 2026-09-22): no size released

Trained on H200 with the unchanged image (PR #63's `causal-conv1d` wheel was measured first and not merged: 21–52 % slower on short rows, 8–12 % faster on 4–6k rows). Every arm served at the temperature fitted on its own development rows. Candidate minus the released checkpoint, paired record-clustered bootstrap (2,000 resamples):

| | 9B (C9) | 4B (C4) | 0.8B (C08) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **long-state panel**, buried questions (591 over 480 records) | 0.572 → **0.739**, +16.8 pp [+12.3, +20.9] ✓ | 0.538 → **0.738**, +20.0 pp [+15.5, +24.4] ✓ | 0.445 → 0.548, +10.3 pp [+5.6, +14.8] ✓ |
| short panel accuracy (transfer-r5, 1,150 knowable) | 0.850 → 0.856, +0.5 pp [−0.5, +1.5] ✓ | 0.840 → 0.840, 0.0 [−1.0, +0.9] ✓ | 0.712 → 0.726, +1.4 pp [0.0, +2.8] ✓ |
| short Brier | 0.223 → 0.210, −0.014 [−0.021, −0.006] ✓ | 0.237 → 0.223, −0.014 [−0.021, −0.006] ✓ | −0.005 [−0.015, +0.005] ✓ |

| transfer-v9 unknowable share ≥ 0.9 | 0.00 ✓ | 0.00 ✓ | 0.00 ✓ |
| SemIf-144 | 0.910 → 0.931 ✓ | 0.889 → 0.889 ✓ | 0.701 → 0.785 ✓ |
| scienthoon-900 | 0.755 → 0.753 ✓ | 0.696 → 0.672 ✗ (−2.4) | 0.520 → 0.463 ✗ (−5.7) |
| WANLI-256 | 0.703 → 0.691 ✗ (**−1.2**, 3 questions) | 0.695 → 0.676 ✗ (−1.9) | 0.590 → 0.586 ✓ |
| TypeSafe (89 answered) | 0.820 → 0.843 ✓ | 0.843 → 0.787 ✗ (−5.6) | 0.629 → 0.618 ✗ (−1.1) |

Kev-9B passes every criterion except WANLI, which it misses by three questions (13 answers go right → wrong, 10 wrong → right; paired CI [−5.1, +2.3]; [`runs/r5-verdict/9b-wanli-flips.json`](runs/r5-verdict/9b-wanli-flips.json)). The locked tests were not read. [`runs/r5-verdict`](runs/r5-verdict/9b.json), [`scripts/round5_confirm.py`](scripts/round5_confirm.py) (committed before the reads), reads under `runs/r5r-*`. Three reads (the released 9B and the round-4 soft-only arm on the long panel, and that arm's short panel) hit the benchmark's one-hour timeout on an H100 before producing any aggregate; their partial predictions were deleted unread and the reads redone on H200 with `benchmarks --timeout`. Spend: Modal metered $557.31 after the round ($110 for it).

Reported, never gating:
- **The long-state gain replicates and is the records' doing.** C9 seed 2: +17.6 pp long, Brier −0.016. The hard-label arm H9 gains the same +16.6 pp on long states; the soft-only arm from round 4 gains nothing (+0.0 pp). The soft targets are what keep the short states healthy: H9 loses 1.2 pp short-state accuracy [−2.4, −0.1] where C9 gains 0.5; at 4B, H4's short Brier gain is a quarter of C4's.
- **WANLI moves the same way in both 9B soft arms** (−1.2 pp here and in #65), while the 4B hard arm is +1.2 and the 4B soft arm −1.9. A plausible mechanism is that 150 of the softened training questions are MNLI, the same task family, so softer NLI targets make NLI answers less decisive. Not established: the interval includes zero.
- **scienthoon drops 1.6–3.9 pp at 4B in every long-state arm** (C4, H4, and round 4's long-only delta), so at 4B the long-state records cost some short, real-world routing accuracy; at 9B they do not (−0.2).
- Diagnostic external reads of H4 and the round-4 long-only delta: `runs/r5d-*`.

**Next (to be registered, not read):** the 9B recipe minus the MNLI soft targets (keep them hard) isolates the WANLI question. It needs fresh panels (both round-5 panels have now been read by these candidates) and a WANLI panel disjoint from the 256 items, large enough that a 1 pp point threshold is not three questions. The external gates in this round were point estimates on 89–256 questions; the next registration should use paired intervals with a margin sized to the suite.

### Release confirmation: soft-target Kev-9B (registered 2026-09-22, before any read below)

4.9 missed its registered coverage gate, but at 9B it improved Brier and halved confident errors with intervals that exclude zero, on the same development items used to select it. This registers one confirmatory read on data never scored by any Kev model, and the rule that decides a release, written before the numbers exist.

- **Arms.** Candidate: `r4-soft/00-trial-0` (Kev-9B + ambiguity soft-target delta, `evals/round4/ambiguity-v1/soft.jsonl`). Parent: the released Kev-9B, `jaredpalmer/kev-9b@2629c06a5aeb0feb3b9783bafed17ed8f39ecf5c` (`night2-9b-du/00-trial-0`). Matched control: `r4-deltas/01-trial-1` (the same records with hard labels). Each arm is served at one temperature fitted on its own decision-v7 development rows (`kev.metrics.served`, `TEMPERATURE_FIT`), as a release would ship it; the parent's is its shipped 2.30.
- **Primary read: the round-3 final panel** `evals/round3/transfer-r3/test.jsonl` (1,260 records frozen for exactly this purpose, sha256 `23e786cc…`, never scored), knowable clean questions, paired record-clustered bootstrap (`paired_bootstrap`, micro, 2,000 resamples, seed 0), candidate minus parent. **All three must hold:** (P1) Brier: upper 95 % bound < 0; (P2) confident-error rate (wrong at p ≥ 0.9, over all questions): upper bound < 0; (P3) accuracy: lower bound ≥ −1 pp. Reported, not gating: the same three against the control, coverage at ≤ 5 % error, AURC, ECE, and the unknowable diagnostics in the panel.
- **Secondary gates** (point estimates, candidate minus parent): `transfer-v9` development unknowable share at p ≥ 0.9 ≤ 0.05; SemIf-144, scienthoon-900, WANLI-256 accuracy and TypeSafe accuracy on answered rows each no worse than −1 pp.
- **Then one locked read** (`modal_app.py::locked_test`, decision-v7 and transfer-v4 test partitions, named `kev-9b-r4-soft`). Pass if transfer-v4 locked accuracy ≥ 0.842 (the parent's 0.852 − 1 pp) and served Brier on the locked transfer items is no higher than the parent's served Brier on the same items (from the parent's saved locked rows).
- **If everything passes:** fit and write the candidate's temperature into `head.pt` with `scripts/calibrate_checkpoint.py`, publish it as the new `jaredpalmer/kev-9b` main with the current weights tagged `night2-du` first, update the card with the raw and served numbers and this criteria outcome. **If anything fails:** no release; the result and the failed criterion are written here, and the next step is re-registered, not re-read.

**Result (read once, 2026-09-22): not released.** Final panel, 1,150 knowable questions, served at T = 1.12 (candidate) / 1.59 (control) / 2.30 (parent):

| | parent (released) | candidate | candidate − parent (95 % CI) | criterion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Brier | 0.2263 | 0.2240 | −0.0023 [−0.0097, +0.0053] | P1 upper < 0: **failed** |
| confident errors | 2.87 % | 1.65 % | −1.22 pp [−2.26, −0.09] | P2 upper < 0: passed |
| accuracy | 0.847 | 0.853 | +0.6 pp [−0.2, +1.4] | P3 lower ≥ −1 pp: passed |
| coverage at ≤ 5 % error / AURC | 0.637 / 0.047 | 0.651 / 0.043 | +1.4 pp [−12.7, +11.3] / −0.004 [−0.010, +0.003] | reported |

Secondary: `transfer-v9` unknowable share at ≥ 0.9 is 0.00 for all three arms (passed); SemIf 0.951 vs 0.910, scienthoon 0.751 vs 0.755, TypeSafe (answered rows) 0.843 vs 0.820 (passed); **WANLI 0.691 vs 0.703, −1.2 pp (failed the −1 pp gate; 3 of 256 questions)**. Against the matched hard-label control the candidate is clearly better (Brier −0.011 [−0.019, −0.003], accuracy +1.1 pp [+0.3, +2.1], AURC −0.006 [−0.012, −0.000]); against the release, only the confident-error reduction replicates. Most of the development-set advantage was the control's loss plus selection on the same items. The locked test was not read. [`runs/rc-verdict/report.json`](runs/rc-verdict/report.json), [`scripts/release_confirm.py`](scripts/release_confirm.py), reads under `runs/rc-*`.

What this leaves: soft targets are the right way to continue training (a hard-label continuation loses accuracy and calibration, a soft one does not), but on their own they are not a release. The round-3 final panel is now spent; any further confirmation needs a new frozen panel, registered before it is built. The natural next candidate is a single Kev-9B delta combining the 4.12 long-state records with the ambiguity soft targets, judged first on the long-state gap (where the effect is +15 pp, not +0.6), with this short-state rule as its non-inferiority guard.

### Round 4 results

Spend so far: Modal metered $407.32 before the 4.8(b) trial (from $405.94 at registration); the external and rotation benchmark passes and the probes are the rest. Every item links its run directory.

A single temperature fitted on the workload's own rows, scored group-disjoint out-of-fold: **WANLI ECE 0.131 → 0.037 (Kev-9B) and 0.166 → 0.052 (Kev-4B)**, paired 95 % CIs on the delta exclude zero; workload T 3.56 / 3.91 against the shipped 2.30 / 2.14. **TypeSafe**: the shipped T already fits (ECE 0.074 → 0.092, 0.158 → 0.175 out of fold, CIs include zero). No arm moves coverage at ≤ 5 % error; WANLI AURC slightly worse. [`runs/kev-*-{wanli,typesafe}-v1/calibration.json`](runs/kev-9b-wanli-v1/calibration.json) | Adopted as reporting (cards updated, rows committed). A deployer's temperature is the fix for workloads far from our distribution, not a new default. |
| 4.2 | `--date_facts` on the four external suites, same checkpoints, same container. SemIf-144, scienthoon-900 and WANLI-256: **identical predictions** (no date arithmetic in those states, the preprocessor is a no-op). TypeSafe: the added day-count lines push **7 more documents past the 8,192-token serving context** (rejected 13 → 20 of 102 questions); on the 82 questions answered both ways accuracy 0.805 → 0.793 (9B) and 0.829 → 0.793 (4B); over all 102 with rejections counted wrong 0.716 → 0.637 and 0.735 → 0.637. [`runs/r4-kev-*-{semif,scienthoon,wanli,typesafe}-{raw,df}`](runs/r4-kev-9b-typesafe-df/report.json) | **Gate failed** (TypeSafe −1.2 / −3.7 pp on common rows, worse over all rows). `KEV_DATE_FACTS` stays opt-in. The win on `transfer-v4` is real but confined to date-bearing short states. |
| 4.3 | Autoresearch incumbent is now a sticky ledger champion (#57): a replication of its recipe (seed-stripped digest) joins it; another recipe must show a positive per-task macro paired-bootstrap delta on transfer accuracy with a 95 % lower bound ≥ −1 pp; the decision is written to `runs/autoresearch.jsonl` (not `leaderboard.jsonl`, which is regenerated on every refresh — a correction to the registered wording). Retrospective: `auto-06b-r1`'s best trial would be kept out (−0.7 pp, CI [−6.1, +4.7]), matching what happened. The review also found that `config_sha256` hashes the seed, so the old "≥ 2 seeds" preference never fired. | Adopted. At 0.6B the interval is ±5 pp wide: a challenger needs roughly +4 pp to replace the champion, which is the point. |
| 4.4 | `kev.benchmark --rotations 16` (#58), `transfer-v4` dev: accuracy 9B 0.822 → 0.819 (−0.3 pp [−1.1, +0.5]), 4B 0.797 → 0.799 (+0.2 [−0.6, +1.1]); **permutation flip rate 0.028 → 0.000 (9B) and 0.083 → 0.028 (4B)**, mean max Δp 0.058 → 0.020 and 0.040 → 0.016 (n = 36 permuted items); coverage at ≤ 5 % error +4.7 / +4.1 pp with CIs including zero; median latency 3.0× / 2.2×. [`runs/r4-kev-*-v4-{one,rot}`](runs/r4-kev-9b-v4-rot/report.json) | Gate met on the flip-rate criterion (halved or better at both sizes), not on accuracy. Per the registration it may become an opt-in serving option; **not implemented yet** — it multiplies latency by the rotation count and the flip sample is small, so it waits for a product decision. |
| 4.5 | Probability-averaged seeds of the v7 recipe, each arm with its own dev-fitted T: 9B (s0 + s1) coverage 0.524 → 0.558 (+3.4 pp [−3.7, +11.3]), Brier −0.002 (CI includes 0); 4B (s2 + s3) Brier **+0.011 [+0.003, +0.018] worse**, AURC worse (the second 4B seed is the weaker 0.770 one); 0.8B (three seeds) coverage −2.6 pp. [`runs/r4-average-*`](runs/r4-average-9b/report.json), [`scripts/checkpoint_average.py`](scripts/checkpoint_average.py) | **Negative.** No size clears +5 pp coverage or a Brier CI below zero; no second `du` seed is trained. |
| 4.6 | MLX (bf16) vs fp32 torch on **all 1,024 clean development records of decision-v7 (1,264 questions)**. **Kev-4B: max \|Δp\| 0.025, mean 0.0016, 1 argmax flip (0 through the prefix cache and the one-question path)**, 3–4 questions above 0.02 — the published 40-record figure holds. **Kev-0.8B: max 0.054, mean 0.0023, 4 flips (0.32 %)**, 11–13 above 0.02; the 60-record figure (max 0.017, 1 flip) understated its tail. Latency on the M5 at this size: 4B MLX 537 ms vs torch fp32 3.8 s on a 703-token record. [`runs/r4-mlx-parity-{4b,0.8b}`](runs/r4-mlx-parity-4b/report.json) | Reporting. README and AGENTS.md now quote the full-partition numbers (claims verified). |
| 4.7 | `scripts/calibrate_checkpoint.py` re-run on Kev-9B and Kev-0.8B: temperatures unchanged (2.30, 2.41), head weights bit-identical, `head.pt["temperature_fit"]["cross_validation"]` now present: OOF ECE 0.076 → 0.028 (9B) and 0.110 → 0.019 (0.8B), both separated. | Done locally; Hub upload of `head.pt` awaits approval (public repos). |
| 4.8(a) | Untrained post-trained `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B` (`c2022362`), `transfer-v4` dev: **SemIf prompt 0.764**, plain 0.712 (the Base: 0.729). But zero-shot `deadline` **0.53 (SemIf) / 0.70 (plain) vs the Base's 0.82**, MMLU 0.74 / 0.78 (Base 0.74), MMLU-Pro on `transfer-v9` 0.53 SemIf / 0.51 plain (Base 0.54). The post-trained 9B does **not** have the stronger date skill the 35B-A3B had (0.88). [`runs/probes/qwen35-9b-{semif,base}-transfer-v{4,9}`](runs/probes/qwen35-9b-semif-transfer-v4/report.json) | Probe gate passed as registered (SemIf ≥ 0.73), so (b) runs. Stated before its result: the premise is weakened — a base that starts at 0.70 on `deadline` is unlikely to reach the 0.85 candidate gate; the trial answers whether Kev training erodes a post-trained 9B the way it erodes the Base. |
| 4.8(b) | `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B` (post-trained) with the v7 recipe (lr 5e-5, 2 epochs, seed 0, H100/H200, 109 min). `transfer-v4` dev: accuracy **0.796**, −2.6 pp [−4.9, −0.5] against the released Kev-9B and −1.7 pp [−3.7, +0.3] against the Base with the same recipe (seed 1, 0.812); **`deadline` 0.47** (its own zero-shot 0.70; the Base-trained 0.72); MMLU 0.738 (unchanged); held-out pairs 0.70 (0.80 / 0.83); served coverage at ≤ 5 % error 0.534, Brier 0.274. [`runs/r4-q35-9b-inst2`](runs/r4-q35-9b-inst2/00-trial-0/result.json), [`runs/r4-readout-posttrained-9b`](runs/r4-readout-posttrained-9b/report.json) (control: the Base, same recipe) | **Negative on every candidate criterion** (deadline ≥ 0.85, transfer within 1 pp, pairs ≥ 0.75); no delta (c), no locked read. Kev training erodes the post-trained 9B's date arithmetic *more* than the Base's. The 35B-A3B's survival (0.88 → 0.95) was about that model, not about post-training. |
| 4.10 | Logistic reliability head on (p_max, margin, normalised entropy, log K, type), fitted on the unused `decision-v7/calibration` partition (1,148 questions, served at the checkpoint's T), evaluated on rows it never saw. `transfer-v4` dev AURC **worse**: 9B 0.0636 → 0.0668 [+0.0002, +0.0061], 4B 0.0583 → 0.0709 [+0.006, +0.021]; coverage at ≤ 5 % error unchanged within wide CIs. WANLI: no change (AURC Δ within ±0.0015). [`runs/r4-reliability-*`](runs/r4-reliability-9b/report.json), [`scripts/reliability_head.py`](scripts/reliability_head.py) | **Negative** (as Solomon found when it dropped its v1.0 head). In-distribution features of the served distribution do not re-rank out-of-distribution errors; the ordering problem needs a different signal. |
| 4.9 | Ambiguity soft targets (1,876 public training questions where the untrained post-trained 9B disagrees with the label at p ≥ 0.6, target = ½ label + ½ teacher; #60), one-epoch delta with 2,000 replay records from the released checkpoint, read against the released checkpoint and a matched delta on the same records with hard labels; each arm served at a temperature fitted on its own development rows. `transfer-v4` dev: **Kev-9B coverage at ≤ 5 % error 0.447 → 0.494 (+4.7 pp [−23, +20])**, accuracy 0.822 → 0.826, Brier 0.264 → 0.252 ([−0.022, −0.002]), ECE 0.042 → 0.021, confident errors 4.0 % → 1.7 % (Jev 3.7 %); against the hard control accuracy +2.0 pp [+0.5, +3.7] and Brier −0.024 [−0.036, −0.013]. **Kev-4B coverage +0.9 pp**, accuracy +0.5, Brier −0.005 (CI includes 0), Brier −0.014 [−0.025, −0.003] against the control. Both soft arms need almost no temperature afterwards (fitted T 1.12 / 1.02 against the released 2.30 / 2.14). [`runs/r4-readout-ambiguity-{9b,4b}`](runs/r4-readout-ambiguity-9b/report.json), [`scripts/round4_deltas.py`](scripts/round4_deltas.py) | **Gate not met** (+5 pp coverage; 9B +4.7, 4B +0.9). Not promoted. What it does show, with CIs excluding zero at 9B: better Brier, half the confident errors, and accuracy above an otherwise identical hard-label delta. The registered primary metric cannot resolve ±5 pp on 656 questions (the 9B interval spans 43 pp); a follow-up should be registered on Brier and confident errors and confirmed once on the unscored 1,260-record round-3 final panel. |
| 4.11 | Kev-9B's served probabilities on its own training partition as ½-label soft targets for a Kev-0.8B delta (all 12,576 records, one epoch, lr 4e-5), against a matched hard-label delta. `transfer-v4` dev: accuracy 0.652 → 0.660 (+0.8 pp [−1.5, +3.2]); against the control +0.2 pp and Brier **+0.016 worse** [+0.001, +0.031]. [`runs/r4-readout-distill-08b`](runs/r4-readout-distill-08b/report.json) | **Negative** (gate +2 pp with a CI above zero). As the #60 description warned, a teacher's probabilities on its own training data (0.931 accurate) carry little beyond the label. |
| 4.12 (baseline) | The released checkpoints on a new eval-only long-state set (`evals/round4/longstate-v1`: decision-v7 development states buried among unrelated records up to ~1k / 2k / 4k tokens, paired with the same questions unburied). **Kev-4B: −26 / −31 / −42 pp; Kev-9B: −22 / −33 / −43 pp** (buried 0.63 / 0.51 / 0.46 against 0.86–0.88 unburied at 9B; n ≈ 122 per length, every CI excludes zero). Scale does not help. This is PLAN_27b's A3 answer, and it is the largest gap measured anywhere in this project. [`runs/r4-kev-*-longstate-2/longstate.json`](runs/r4-kev-9b-longstate-2/longstate.json), [`scripts/longstate_report.py`](scripts/longstate_report.py) | Reporting; sizes 4.12's delta (running) and PLAN_27b B2. |
| 4.12 (delta) | One-epoch Kev-4B delta on 1,800 long-state training records (decision-v7/train primaries buried to ~1k / 2k / 4k tokens, `--max_state 4608`) + 2,000 replay, against a matched delta on the same primaries unburied and against the released checkpoint. **Long states** (`longstate-v1` development, buried questions): accuracy **0.616 / 0.533 / 0.463 → 0.800 / 0.713 / 0.554** at 1k / 2k / 4k; burial cost −26 / −31 / −42 pp → **−8 / −14 / −30 pp**; +15.2 pp [+9.6, +20.2] over the released checkpoint and +15.5 pp [+10.3, +20.7] over the short control, which alone changes nothing (−29 / −31 / −41 pp). **Short states** (`transfer-v4` dev): accuracy 0.797 → 0.802 (+0.5 pp [−0.8, +1.7]) against the released checkpoint, AURC 0.058 → 0.052 [−0.010, −0.003], Brier −0.010 [−0.017, −0.003]; against the short control −1.4 pp [−3.0, +0.2]. [`runs/r4-longstate-long-ls`](runs/r4-longstate-long-ls/longstate.json), [`runs/r4-readout-longstate-4b-short`](runs/r4-readout-longstate-4b-short/report.json) | Informational, as registered. The answer is better than hoped: a $3 delta closes two thirds of the gap at 1–2k tokens with no measurable short-state cost against the release (the control comparison allows up to −3 pp). 4k stays weak with 600 training records at that length, so the length mix, not the architecture, is the next lever. This sizes PLAN_27b B2 downward: long context is a data problem at the current sizes. |

Found by review during this round: `kev.data.none_pair` built minimal pairs on soft-target questions, training zero mass on the label in the option-removed sibling (fixed in #60). The released night-2 deltas saw ~a dozen such pairs (50 eligible Choice questions in `dates_unknowable.jsonl` at `p_none_pair` 0.25); judged too small to retrain for. The round-4 soft-target trials launched before the fix were cancelled and relaunched.

**Round 4 closed** (2026-09-22). Modal metered **$464.31** at the end ($58.37 for the round, within the $60 envelope; admission bounds were never binding). Adopted: per-workload calibration reporting (4.1), the paired-CI incumbent rule (4.3), full-partition parity numbers (4.6), the OOF audit field (4.7, Hub upload pending approval). Informative: long states are a data problem the current sizes can learn cheaply (4.12). Negative: 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 4.10, 4.11; 4.9 missed its gate with a Brier / confident-error signal worth a registered follow-up; 4.4 met its gate but a serving mode waits for a product decision.

**What round 4 changes for [`PLAN_27b.md`](PLAN_27b.md):** (1) do not pin a post-trained base on the strength of date arithmetic, which Kev training erodes either way; question-side LoRA (A1) is the remaining test of whether the erosion is document-side. (2) The long-document track (B2) should start from the 4.12 recipe: a length-mixed delta with more 4k-plus records, measured on `longstate-v1`, before any 27B spend. (3) The A2 probe still decides on knowledge (MMLU-Pro) and the SemIf / WANLI ceilings.

## Round 2 autoresearch (2026-09-20 → 21) — done; results below

Ordered by expected value. Each trial is either a **delta** (warm start from the released checkpoint, new records mixed with a replay sample of `decision-v7`, lr 2e-5, 1 epoch) or a **probe** (no training). Selection on development partitions only; one locked read per adopted candidate.

| # | question | run | cost | adopt if (pre-registered) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Does a bigger MoE base fix the knowledge column? | Zero-shot probe of `Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Base` on `transfer-v4` + `v9` (H200) | $6 | **Proceed to a Kev-35B-A3B trial** only if MMLU-Pro ≥ 0.70 and overall ≥ the 9B base's 0.729. |
| 2 | Can calibration be bought without accuracy? (a) per-(type, K) temperature fitted on dev; (b) unknowable records with **uniform targets** as a delta from Kev-9B / Kev-4B | (a) $0, (b) 2 deltas ~$8 | Adopt if coverage@5 % error improves ≥ +5 pp on `transfer-v4` dev with accuracy within 1 pp of the released checkpoint; for (b) also unknowable share ≥ 0.9 falls (4B: 0.19 → ≤ 0.10). Temperature is reported as a separate row, never folded into raw numbers. |
| 3 | Date arithmetic by construction (issue #8): date-bearing families rendered with relational day counts and a `date_facts` field; opt-in `date_facts` request preprocessor | 2 deltas ~$8 | Adopt the renderings if `deadline` ≥ 0.85 **with** the preprocessor and raw `deadline` does not fall, accuracy elsewhere within 1 pp. Report raw and preprocessed separately. |
| 4 | Assertion-style Noul instructions | 1 delta each at 9B / 4B ~$8 | Adopt if scienthoon `angry` ≥ 0.85 at 4B with `transfer-v4` within 1 pp. |
| 5 | Where does the eroded arithmetic live? Retention ablation: 4B from scratch, LoRA on attention + MLP only (DeltaNet projections frozen) | 1 trial $5 | Informational; if `deadline` ≥ 0.65 raw, DeltaNet-frozen becomes a candidate recipe for a follow-up. |
| 6 | Combined delta (2b + 3 + 4) from Kev-9B and Kev-4B | 2 deltas ~$10 | Same rules as its parts; this is the promotion candidate if the parts pass. |
| 7 | Third-party comparability: Kev-9B / 4B on ekzhang's 1,000-question MMLU-Pro sample (seed 42); GPQA-diamond as an eval-only source if the dataset is accessible | $3 | Reporting only. |
| 8 | If #1 passes: Kev-35B-A3B, `decision-v7`, lr 5e-5, LoRA on attention + DeltaNet + shared expert, routed experts frozen, H200/B200 | ~$40 | Ship as a hosted tier only if `transfer-v4` dev ≥ Kev-9B + 2 pp **and** MMLU-Pro ≥ 0.70; one locked read. |

Rules: accuracy comparisons are record-clustered paired bootstraps on the same items; "within 1 pp" means the point estimate. Deltas replace a released checkpoint only after the locked read confirms no regression there. Every adopted change is written into the model cards with the criteria outcome, met or not.

Deferred, in order: MLX serving for the hybrid on Mac (the release's one regression: 0.78 s vs 0.17 s at 4B); multilingual slices; high-cardinality column; GGUF/browser path.

## Results (2026-09-21, 02:30)

Spend tonight ≈ $105 (probes $14, deltas 12 × ~$1.5, dense $5, benches ~$15, locked reads $8, five failed or duplicated 35B launches ~$18, two 35B trials $24). Budget authorization: ~$475 of $500 used. Working notes were kept in `scratchpad.txt` (deleted; in git history up to f3bae08).

| # | result | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Base** zero-shot: `transfer-v4` 0.720 (9B base 0.729), MMLU 0.82, **MMLU-Pro 0.590**, deadline 0.75, rules worse. | Gate failed (needed MMLU-Pro ≥ 0.70). No base-MoE trial. |
| 1′ | **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (post-trained)** zero-shot with the SemIf prompt: **0.812** = trained Kev-9B; MMLU 0.85, deadline 0.88, emotion 0.62; rules weak (0.62 / 0.56). Plain prompt 0.726. | Gate passed (≥ 0.76) → two trials. |
| 8 | **Kev on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** (v7 recipe, `--weights_dtype bf16`, LoRA 21 M on attention + DeltaNet + shared expert, routed experts frozen, H200, 136–158 min, 72 GB peak): lr 5e-5 → dev 0.869, **transfer 0.823** (+1.2 pp vs Kev-9B [−3.0, +5.5]; −3.2 vs Jev [−7.7, +1.2]); lr 2e-5 → 0.819. Profile: deadline **0.93 / 0.95** (Jev 0.93; the post-trained base's date skill survives training), MMLU 0.81 / 0.80 (+7 over Kev-9B, −9 vs Jev), held-out pairs 0.84 / 0.88 (Jev 0.86); but TweetEval 0.75 / 0.71 (Kev-9B 0.78), Emotion 0.57 / 0.54, `or_not` rule 0.78 (0.88), confident errors 8.8–9.1 %, coverage@5 % 0.50 / 0.40 (0.53). `transfer-v9` (lr 5e-5): knowable 0.778 (Kev-9B 0.771), **MMLU-Pro 0.550** (Kev-9B 0.545, Jev 0.840 — the base's MMLU gain did not carry to 10-way MMLU-Pro), buried 0.68 (0.74), unknowable share ≥ 0.9 0.14 (0.05). | **Not shipped.** Fails the pre-registered bar (≥ Kev-9B + 2 pp); lands where Kev-9B + dates + unknowable already is (0.822 dev / 0.852 locked) with worse calibration and 8× the memory. It does answer the question: a bigger post-trained base buys knowledge and dates and loses noisy-label classification; it does not reach Jev on this suite. Checkpoint kept on the volume (`night2-36b6/00-trial-0`); a 35B + dates/unknowable delta is a possible follow-up, not a priority. |
| 2a | Single temperature T ≈ 2.0 fitted in-distribution **does** transfer OOD on the Qwen3.5 family: Kev-9B Brier 0.291 → 0.267, ECE 0.105 → 0.039, confident errors 7.5 % → 3.2 % (Jev 3.7 %), accuracy and coverage unchanged. Per-(type, K) temperatures are worse (OOD Score items have a K the in-distribution fit never saw; per-group scaling scrambles the cross-group confidence ranking). | Adopt as a reported **calibrated row**; `KEV_TEMPERATURE` in `kev.serve`. The coverage criterion was ill-posed for a global T (monotone). Grouped T rejected. |
| 2b | Unknowable records with uniform targets (delta): share of evidence-free items answered at ≥ 0.9 → **0.00** at both sizes (from 0.05 / 0.19), controls unchanged. Coverage@5 % on `transfer-v4` dev: 9B 0.53 → 0.48, 4B 0.54 → 0.57. | Confidence criterion passed decisively; coverage criterion failed at 9B. Partial. |
| 3 | Date renderings (delta) + `date_facts` preprocessor: deadline 9B 0.72 → 0.80 raw → **0.90 with the preprocessor**; 4B 0.55 → 0.60 → 0.82 (0.85 in the combined delta). The preprocessor alone on the released models: 0.75 / 0.68 — training to *bind* the fact is what makes it work. | **Passed** (≥ 0.85 with preprocessor, raw not lower, accuracy within 1 pp). |
| 4 | Assertion-style Noul (delta): scienthoon `angry` 4B 0.794 → 0.821 alone, 0.859 in the combined delta; 9B 0.911 → 0.924. Side effect: raises confidence on evidence-free items (unknowable share 0.05 → 0.25 at 9B) and adds a few p = 1.00 errors on Noul tasks (tweet, PAWS) that cut coverage. | Passed only in combination; the combination's coverage cost is partly this. |
| 5 | Dense ablation (LoRA on attention + MLP only, DeltaNet frozen, 4B seed 1): deadline **0.53 → 0.53**, transfer 0.800 → 0.780. | Freezing the recurrent layers does not preserve date arithmetic. Not a candidate. |
| 6 | Combined deltas, **locked test** (one read each): 9B + dates + unknowable **0.852** OOD (+1.8 pp [+0.8, +2.9] over Kev-9B's 0.837), Brier 0.237, deadline 0.88, pairs 0.81, coverage@5 % 0.62 (from 0.66); 9B + all 0.851; 4B + dates + unknowable 0.837 (+1.0 [−0.1, +2.1]), Brier 0.255, coverage 0.68; 4B + all 0.828 (neutral). | **Promotion candidates: the dates + unknowable deltas at both sizes**, published as Hub branch `night2-du` (main untouched, awaiting sign-off). Costs to state in the cards: coverage@5 % −4 pp at 9B, scienthoon ECE +3 pp, MMLU-Pro −3 pp at 9B. |
| 7 | ekzhang's 1,000-question MMLU-Pro sample: Kev-9B **0.511**, Kev-4B 0.468, Kev-8B (Qwen3) 0.488 (8 questions over the 384-token state limit counted wrong). Jev 0.829; untrained one-token Qwen3.6-35B-A3B 0.588; his $5 SFT ≈ 0.71. | Reporting. Knowledge is base-bound; the 3.6 trial is the only lever. GPQA-diamond is gated — needs the account to accept terms. |

### Decisions taken (2026-09-21, morning, signed off)

1. **Promoted the dates + unknowable deltas** to the main Hub revisions of `kev-9b`, `kev-4b` and `kev-0.8b` (the 0.8B delta ran in the morning: locked test 0.668 → 0.684, +2.2 pp [−0.8, +5.5], Brier 0.473 → 0.460). Pre-delta weights at tag `v7-base`; release tarballs `*-v7-base.tar.gz`. Cards state the costs (coverage@5 % −4 pp at 9B, scienthoon ECE +3 pp, MMLU-Pro −3 pp at 9B).
2. **Calibration built into the checkpoints** (2026-09-21, later the same day): `head.pt` carries a temperature fitted on the trial's development rows (9B 2.30, 4B 2.14, 0.8B 2.41) and the pointer head applies it in eval mode, so every loader serves calibrated probabilities by default; `KEV_TEMPERATURE=1.0` gives raw logits. Out-of-domain ECE 0.106 → 0.042 (9B), confident errors 8.7 % → 4.0 % (Jev 3.7 %); accuracy unchanged. Coverage at ≤ 5 % error is not moved by a temperature — that needs training-side calibration (`PLAN_27b.md` §5).
3. **`date_facts` preprocessor** shipped opt-in (`KEV_DATE_FACTS=1`), documented as preprocessing with separate numbers.
4. The Qwen3.6-35B-A3B checkpoint stays a research artifact.

## Round 3 autoresearch — audited execution on `research/calibration-audit`

**Execution order approved:** metric audit → failure audit → matched loss screen → replicate a promising candidate → fresh final audit → decide whether a larger-model study is justified. No published weights or production deployment will be changed by this round. The binding machine-readable protocol is [`experiments/calibration-audit-protocol.json`](experiments/calibration-audit-protocol.json); it is frozen before new training results.

### Measurement and failure audit

- [`scripts/calibration_audit.py`](scripts/calibration_audit.py) re-scores saved development predictions into a **new** [`report`](runs/calibration-audit-v1/report.json), leaving the originals unchanged. The old coverage metric could split equal-confidence ties and gave 0.94 or 0.00 for the same synthetic predictions under a row permutation. Version 2 admits whole tie groups. Jev's observed coverage changes from 0.704 to 0.695; the saved Kev values are unchanged (4B 0.573, 9B 0.447 after approximate temperature replay).
- Coverage is a non-additive statistic: the paired bootstrap now resamples complete record groups and recomputes the curve, rather than bootstrapping per-row coverage values. The wide intervals on this small set motivate reporting the entire risk–coverage curve and AURC, not claiming a deployment guarantee from one empirical 5% cutoff. AURC uses a documented right-step integral over complete confidence groups. See [`kev/metrics.py`](kev/metrics.py) and its regression tests in [`tests/test_research.py`](tests/test_research.py).
- The previous statement that temperature cannot reorder confidence was incorrect. Positive temperature preserves each question's argmax, but may reorder top probabilities between multiclass questions, including equal-K questions. New local evaluations preserve raw logits and record effective temperature; historical probability replay is explicitly marked approximate because it applies a floor to rounded/saturated probabilities.
- High-confidence-error **share** divides by all questions; error **among accepted answers** divides by accepted questions. At p_max ≥ 0.9, saved Kev-9B has 26/656 = 4.0% of all questions wrong but 6.8% error among accepted answers. These are not interchangeable calibration claims.
- The [AI-assisted failure audit](runs/calibration-audit-v1/summary.json) inspects 26 confident errors and 26 matched correct controls. It finds executable rule errors, omitted facts, role-binding mistakes, ambiguous renderings, and possible annotation inconsistencies. **No label is changed, and this is not human adjudication.** [PAWS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01130) is an adversarial human-judged reading benchmark; difficulty and teacher disagreement do not prove label noise. Cross-entropy is a proper scoring rule, not an established root cause of these failures. [Guo et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599) motivates calibration measurement, not a causal diagnosis of Kev.

### Small, matched screen

Use the pinned Kev-4B parent from the protocol, seed 11, one epoch, lr 2e-5, effective batch 8. All four arms see the exact same 3,425 frozen training records, augmentations, ordering, and number of optimizer updates. A re-evaluated unchanged parent and a standard-CE continuation control are both required.

| arm | loss on hard-labelled questions | motivation |
|---|---|---|
| CE control | ordinary cross-entropy | separates extra training from changing the loss |
| smoothing | CE against `(1−0.05) one_hot(y) + 0.05/K` | limited regularization, not assumed equivalent to temperature; [Müller et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02629) |
| CE + Brier | CE + 0.5 × sum of squared probability error | proper-scoring alternative; [Gneiting & Raftery](https://doi.org/10.1198/016214506000001437) |
| focal | `(1−p_y) × CE` (gamma 1) | empirical hard-example weighting; no promised calibration gain; [Mukhoti et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09437) |

Existing soft-target records use the same soft-target CE in every arm. Temperature is fitted from raw logits on **decision-r3/calibration**, never on development or final-test labels. Report both raw and recalibrated metrics, per-source results, and all failed trials. Teacher relabelling, the entropy-penalty grid, full retraining, and ensembles are deferred until there is evidence to justify them.

**Screening gate:** at least +5 percentage points of tie-aware micro coverage against **both** CE control and recalibrated parent; micro accuracy no more than 1 point worse; no source more than 5 points worse; AURC no worse. This screening gate is exploratory, not a significance claim. Advance at most one recipe, ranked by coverage, then AURC, NLL, and fixed arm order. If none passes, stop and leave the fresh test unscored.

**Replication gate:** best loss versus matched CE controls at seeds 12 and 13 on 4B and 9B, within the remaining budget. Require positive coverage differences at both seeds and ≥5 points mean gain, the same accuracy/AURC constraints, unknowable high-confidence share ≤0.05, and intact-control accuracy within 2 points of the parent. Write the chosen checkpoint hashes before any final read. Record-group bootstrap intervals do not measure training-seed variability; report seeds separately.

### Fresh final audit and spend control

[`scripts/freeze_calibration_audit.py`](scripts/freeze_calibration_audit.py) freezes [`decision-r3`](evals/round3/decision-r3/manifest.json) and [`transfer-r3`](evals/round3/transfer-r3/manifest.json). The latter contains 580 new threshold-calibration records and **1,260 new final-test records**, including separate unknowable/control diagnostics. The builder excludes recorded prior normalized states and public-source origins, preserves generated groups, and verifies zero final-test overlap with training, calibration, and development. This does not establish absence from foundation-model pretraining. No fresh-test predictions have been read at registration.

A qualifying recipe is evaluated once against its pinned parent and matching CE control. Select acceptance thresholds using the fresh threshold-calibration partition, then freeze them and apply them to the final set without re-selection. Recommend promotion only if the final coverage gain is ≥5 points against both controls with paired 95% CI lower bound >0, accuracy CI lower bound ≥−1 point, AURC no worse, and fixed-threshold empirical risk ≤5% on at least 100 accepted knowable questions. Report failure rather than choosing another candidate after reading this set. Previous test partitions are now historical regression evidence, not untouched confirmation.

Modal reports **$392.14 metered** at registration; this supersedes the previous unverified $475 estimate. The user subsequently authorized **$1,000 total**, before any new training runs. Keep the initial stage within **$60**; reserve further spending only for evidence-backed follow-ups, with a conservative $600 additional ceiling and a fresh billing check before each stage. Experimental gates are unchanged by the budget increase. Bound launches using the actual requested CPU, memory and GPU limits; do not redeploy `kev-research`, cancel other jobs, overwrite outputs, move release tags, or publish checkpoints. The possible $10,000 credit grant is not authorized spend. The larger-model work in [`PLAN_27b.md`](PLAN_27b.md) remains gated.

### Round 3 screening result — stopped at the registered gate

All five jobs completed under [`calibration-screen-4b-s11-r2`](runs/calibration-screen-4b-s11-r2/results.jsonl). Each trained arm used exactly **3,899 records including augmentations, 429 optimizer steps, and 639,399 forward tokens** from the same 3,425-record corpus. The initial startup failed before training because the optional HF-secret dependency was declared differently locally and remotely; its five calls were cancelled with explicit approval, the environment was corrected, and the failed attempt is [recorded separately](runs/calibration-screen-startup/report.json). The production app was not redeployed.

[Full comparison and paired intervals](runs/calibration-screen-review-v1/report.json), [concise outcome](runs/calibration-screen-review-v1/summary.json), [risk–coverage curves](runs/calibration-screen-review-v1/risk-coverage-final.png), and [`scripts/review_calibration_screen.py`](scripts/review_calibration_screen.py). All values below are on the same 656 clean development questions, after fitting each checkpoint's temperature on the same independent calibration partition using raw logits. No test labels were used for fitting or selection. The generic runner's legacy NLL-based candidate flag is not this protocol's promotion gate; the authoritative screen selected no candidate.

| arm | accuracy | coverage at ≤5% empirical error | AURC ↓ | Brier ↓ | ECE ↓ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| unchanged Kev-4B, recalibrated | 0.7973 | **0.5762** | **0.0580** | **0.2653** | 0.0478 |
| CE continuation control | 0.7973 | 0.5320 | 0.0625 | 0.2737 | 0.0519 |
| label smoothing, epsilon 0.05 | 0.8018 | 0.0061 | 0.1001 | 0.2879 | 0.0671 |
| CE + Brier, weight 0.5 | 0.7973 | 0.5259 | 0.0628 | 0.2744 | 0.0561 |
| focal, gamma 1 | 0.7988 | 0.5015 | 0.0606 | 0.2678 | **0.0433** |

**Decision: no candidate advances.** Focal improves ECE slightly but not selective coverage or AURC. Smoothing slightly improves accuracy while harming ranking: AURC difference versus parent +0.0422 [95% CI +0.0228, +0.0651]. CE continuation also worsens selective performance, confirming why the matched control was necessary. These are results for one seed, one epoch and one setting per loss; they do not show that these losses fail universally.

As registered, **no replication, fresh threshold-calibration read, final-test read, publication, or larger-model run** follows this negative screen. The 1,260-record final panel remains unscored and available for a future preregistered candidate. The reasonable next question is a targeted data/capability experiment (for example, controlled role-binding counterexamples from permitted training sources), not an expanded loss grid or automatic relabelling of PAWS. It needs its own registration before spending.

Workspace metering initially showed $403.87 after the pass, then revised to **$398.32** on the final check: about **$6.18 above the $392.14 starting reading**, subject to billing lag and workspace attribution. Both observations are retained in the outcome summary; neither is an exact per-trial invoice. The authorized ceiling is $1,000, not a target to spend. The successful screen's conservative function-execution admission bound was $18.92, excluding startup/storage. No historical benchmark file or published checkpoint was overwritten.

### Training-data investigation after the negative screen

Analysis first, no training launched. Where the current checkpoints fail on the rule tasks ([`runs/binding-diagnostic-v1/report.json`](runs/binding-diagnostic-v1/report.json), [`scripts/build_binding_diagnostic.py`](scripts/build_binding_diagnostic.py)):

- **Every Kev-4B rule error on `transfer-v4` development involves an `elapsed` (date-difference) atom**: 0.78 on structures with one, 1.00 on the 64 without; with `KEV_DATE_FACTS=1` 0.94. The 564 compositional training records with `elapsed` atoms never state a day count. Errors are not near the threshold (they occur at a +10-day margin too), so this is absent arithmetic, not off-by-one.
- **Kev-9B's ten rule errors sit in four generated groups** (three renderings each), all confident `accept` on `reject` labels, all with `match` ("X is the same person as Y") or `elapsed` atoms. On the existing rows 9B scored 0/6 when a compared name recurred elsewhere in the case — but those six items are two groups.

A fresh eval-only diagnostic (560 records, code labels, new seed, disjoint from every frozen suite; inference only, ~$2) tested both readings with real sample sizes:

| stratum (n) | Kev-4B | Kev-9B |
|---|---|---|
| match true (120) | 0.992 | 0.992 |
| mismatch, clean (120) | 0.975 | 0.967 |
| mismatch, decoy name in another role (120) | 0.917 | 0.967 |
| mismatch, second matching pair shares a name (120) | 0.967 | 1.000 |
| elapsed rule, dates only (40) | 0.650 | 0.750 |
| same cases with the day count stated (40) | **1.000** | **0.975** |

**H1 (dates) confirmed:** 14 (4B) and 9 (9B) paired cases flip from wrong to right when the day count is stated; none flip back. The models already use a stated count; what they cannot do is subtract. That makes it a **serving question, not a training-data one**: training on day-count renderings would not change the plain case, and the earlier ablations showed fine-tuning erodes rather than teaches the arithmetic. The decision to take is whether `KEV_DATE_FACTS` becomes the serving default (development accuracy 0.797 → 0.820 at 4B, 0.822 → 0.828 at 9B, no observed harm elsewhere) — a product choice, still reported as preprocessing.

**H2 (name-co-occurrence shortcut) not supported:** at 9B the decoy strata equal the clean stratum. The 0/6 was two correlated groups — exactly the small-sample trap the audit warned about. Kev-4B shows a small effect (0.917 vs 0.975, 9 of 10 errors answer `accept`), worth at most ~1 pp on rule tasks; decoy-augmented training data is not a priority.

**Not pursued:** PAWS-style role binding in natural text. There is no permitted programmatic source that yields reliable labels for swapped-role paraphrases, and PAWS itself stays eval-only; this would need human-labelled data and its own registration.

### Superseded initial round-3 proposal (retained for the research record)

The draft below predates the metric/failure audit. Its causal claims, teacher identity, budget and timing estimates, temperature-ordering argument, and test-selection procedure are superseded by the registered execution protocol above; they are not instructions for this run.

**Why.** After the built-in temperature, Kev's probabilities have the right *scale* — Kev-9B out-of-domain ECE 0.042, confident errors 4.0 % ([card](docs/model-cards/kev-9b.md); Jev 0.049 / 3.7 % on the same items, [`runs/jev-transfer-v4/report.json`](runs/jev-transfer-v4/report.json)) — but not the right *order*. Coverage at a ≤ 5 % error budget, the share of decisions that can be accepted in confidence order before the accepted set exceeds 5 % error ([`kev/metrics.py: coverage_at_error`](kev/metrics.py), the metric from [AbdelStark/jev-benchmarks](https://github.com/AbdelStark/jev-benchmarks)), is **0.45 at 9B and 0.57 at 4B vs Jev's 0.70**. A temperature is monotone within a question, so it cannot move this ([`scripts/temperature_groups.py`](scripts/temperature_groups.py): coverage 0.53 → 0.52 at T = 2.0). The ceiling at Kev-9B's accuracy (0.822) is 0.86 if confidence ranked correctness perfectly; the gap to Jev is ordering, not accuracy.

**Where the ordering fails** (served probabilities, `transfer-v4` development, [`runs/night2-9b-du/00-trial-0/transfer/rows.json`](runs/night2-9b-du/00-trial-0/transfer/rows.json)): 26 of 656 answers are wrong at ≥ 0.9, and **16 of them are PAWS** (adversarial paraphrase pairs); at 4B, 10 of 17. Across all errors, 59 % are on the three noisy-label sources (TweetEval, PAWS, Emotion), which are 37 % of the items. The training loss is hard-label cross-entropy ([`kev/train.py: question_loss`](kev/train.py)), which asks for certainty on items that are genuinely ambiguous — the textbook cause of over-confidence in fine-tuned classifiers ([Guo et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04599)).

**What to try** — each is a flag on `question_loss`, run as a **delta** from the released checkpoint (`--init_from`, replay 2000, lr 2e-5, one epoch: ~15 min / ~$1.50 at 9B, [round-2 recipe](#round-2-autoresearch-2026-09-20--21--done-results-below)), then the temperature re-fitted with [`scripts/calibrate_checkpoint.py`](scripts/calibrate_checkpoint.py) because every loss below changes the logit scale.

| # | change | mechanism | reference | cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | **Label smoothing** ε ∈ {0.05, 0.1} | soft target (1−ε) on the label, ε/K elsewhere; known to improve calibration, mostly by shrinking confidence uniformly — a baseline that may behave like the temperature | [Müller, Kornblith & Hinton, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02629) | 2 deltas × 2 sizes |
| C2 | **Focal loss** γ ∈ {1, 2} | down-weights already-confident correct items so the gradient concentrates on hard ones; shown to yield calibrated networks without post-hoc scaling | [Mukhoti et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09437) | 2 × 2 |
| C3 | **Cross-entropy + Brier term** λ ∈ {0.5, 1} | Brier is a proper scoring rule with bounded penalty for confident mistakes; the ordinal RPS term already in the trainer ([`--ord_w`](kev/train.py)) is its ordered cousin | [Gneiting & Raftery, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1198/016214506000001437) | 2 × 2 |
| C4 | **Confidence penalty** β ∈ {0.05, 0.1} | adds −β·H(p) to the loss: rewards entropy where the label does not dominate | [Pereyra et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06548) | 2 × 2 |
| C5 | **Ambiguity soft targets** on the public sources | where an open teacher (Qwen3.5-9B instruct, SemIf prompt — our strongest untrained readout, 0.747 on `transfer-v4`, [`runs/probes/qwen35-4b-semif-transfer-v4`](runs/probes/qwen35-4b-semif-transfer-v4/report.json)) disagrees with the label at ≥ 0.6, train toward a mixture of label and teacher instead of the hard label; the same mechanism as the unknowable records ([`evals/night2`](evals/night2/manifest.json), [`kev/data.py: materialize target`](kev/data.py)). Targets the actual cause; teacher outputs are open-weight, never Jev's. | [Hinton et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531) (soft targets); our round-2 unknowable result | half a day of data work + 1 × 2 |
| C6 | **Two-checkpoint averaging** at serve time | averaging two seeds' probabilities improves calibration reliably; doubles serving cost | [Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01474) | $0 (existing seeds) |

**Pre-registered rules.**
- Metric: coverage at ≤ 5 % error on `transfer-v4` development, *served* probabilities (after re-fitting T on the trial's own development rows, never on transfer or test). Secondary: Brier, confident-error rate, `unknowable` share ≥ 0.9 on `transfer-v9` (must not rise above 0.05).
- Adopt a change if coverage improves by **≥ +5 pp** with accuracy within 1 pp of the released checkpoint (paired, record-clustered bootstrap, [`kev.metrics.paired_bootstrap`](kev/metrics.py)); report every trial regardless.
- If no delta clears the bar, one full retrain at 9B with the best-looking loss (~$7, 90 min) before concluding that calibration needs the full run rather than a touch-up.
- Winners get one locked read and replace the released checkpoint under the same name, with the raw and served columns in the card.
- Expectation stated in advance: partial — 9B 0.45 → 0.55–0.60. Closing to 0.70 probably needs accuracy gains too (coverage and accuracy are coupled).

**Cost and time.** ~20 deltas ≈ $30, ~4 h wall; C5's data step half a day; locked reads and republish the next morning. Fits the remaining round-2 budget; does not draw on the 27B credits ([`PLAN_27b.md`](PLAN_27b.md)).

## Open questions

- Why does LoRA fine-tuning on classification-shaped data erase multi-step latent computation (dates) while leaving recall (MMLU) intact? Freezing the DeltaNet layers does not help (trial 5), and on the post-trained 3.6 base the skill *survives* (0.88 → 0.95), so the erosion is specific to Base checkpoints. Layer-wise LoRA ablation and a post-trained 9B (Qwen3.5-9B instruct) are the next probes.
- Answered for tonight: the 35B-A3B step buys knowledge (+7 MMLU) and dates, costs noisy-label classification and calibration, nets +1 pp. A post-trained *dense* 9B is the untested middle.
- Does the unknowable-record training transfer to *unseen* kinds of missing evidence (scienthoon's org-rule priority is the external test)?
- Is Kev's over-confidence on PAWS a label-noise problem (the pairs are adversarially close) or a capability one? C5 in round 3 separates them: if teacher-label disagreement predicts the confident errors, it is the former.

# History

## Current decision

Use **Qwen3-0.6B-Base as the research baseline**. Keep the released Qwen2.5 checkpoint as a historical reference, not as an equally funded development track. Preserve the MacBook training path; run the controlled studies on Modal H100s.

On the same v2 recipe and data, Qwen3's development accuracy was 81.6% / 79.3% across two seeds, versus 74.2% / 65.8% for Qwen2.5. Transfer accuracy was 62.0% / 62.1% versus 60.5% / 48.2%. This supports our backbone choice, not a claim that every Qwen3 model dominates every Qwen2.5 model.

Evidence: [ablation-v2 ledger](runs/ablation-v2/results.jsonl), [Qwen3 seed 0](runs/ablation-v2/06-trial-6/result.json), [Qwen3 seed 1](runs/ablation-v2/07-trial-7/result.json).

## Evidence and corrections

- Original Kev versus Jev on familiar sources: 79.7% versus 81.1% micro accuracy; macro difference −1.8 points, 95% CI [−5.5, +1.7]. An interval including zero is not evidence of equivalence. [Comparison](runs/kev-vs-jev-v1.json), [figure](docs/kev-benchmark.png).
- Original Kev versus Jev on transfer-v1: 63.3% versus 82.3%, macro difference −19.1 points, CI [−23.1, −15.0]. The overlap check covered 1,360 decision-v1 training/calibration states, **not every example used to train the released checkpoint**. Public pretraining overlap is unknown for both models. [Comparison](runs/kev-vs-jev-transfer-v1.json), [manifest](evals/transfer-v1/manifest.json).
- Lower aggregate ECE on transfer-v1 did not establish generally better calibration. Qwen3 trial 6 gets 50% authorization accuracy with 99.6% mean confidence on transfer-v2. Its familiar-source ECE falls from .073 to .026 after fitting temperature on calibration; this does not establish transfer calibration. [Result](runs/ablation-v2/06-trial-6/result.json).
- Jev's zero observed argmax flips do **not** prove architectural invariance. Its probabilities move under permutation. [Jev transfer-v1 report](runs/transfer-jev-v1/report.json).
- A none-present accuracy of 25% means 75% wrong, not necessarily 75% selecting none. Report actual none-option mass and selection separately. [Original comparison diagnostics](runs/kev-vs-jev-transfer-v1.json).
- MMLU and domain-transfer failures do not by themselves identify a knowledge versus readout bottleneck. We need a controlled capacity/data experiment.
- Two v2 issues were found: siblings shuffled their sentence order independently, and calibration took the first slice of a family-ordered synthetic list. Pair metrics also compared option indices rather than semantic keys. Fix these under **v3**, with tests; do not rewrite v2 again.

## Nimble research

[Bespoke Nimble](https://github.com/bespokelabsai/nimble), [model card](https://huggingface.co/bespokelabs/Bespoke-Nimble-9B), [dataset guide](https://github.com/bespokelabsai/nimble/blob/main/docs/DATASET.md).

The inspected release trained a Qwen3.5-9B LoRA adapter on 2,676 synthetic contrastive records. It reported 90.1% agreement with synthetic reference labels versus Jev's 93.2% on 324 records from six source families. These are useful external research results, not measurements on our evaluation suite or proof of broad parity. In the inspected checkout, `data/` was ignored and the dataset guide required separately supplied files; no directly usable dataset was found during that review.

Adopt minimal factual edits, executable labels where possible, evidence checks, and grouped splits. A check on structured fact dictionaries does not independently validate the English rendering. Separate model calls also do not eliminate correlated synthetic-label errors. Hard outcome labels with a proper scoring rule are sufficient; teacher probabilities are not required.

Nimble scores letter tokens and supports a hybrid recurrent backbone through separate field execution. Our current packed mask alone does not isolate recurrent state, so Qwen3.5 is not a drop-in replacement. This does not make hybrid models fundamentally unusable.

## v3 protocol (approved)

### 1. Correctness and immutable artifacts

- Preserve all existing suite versions and run directories. New freezes and Modal trials refuse to overwrite existing paths, including failure artifacts.
- Match sentence order and option order inside a minimal pair. Change one decisive fact only.
- Stratify calibration by family while keeping pairs/groups together.
- Reject incomplete or duplicated pairs. Compare semantic answer keys, not their positions.
- Preserve locked-test bytes. New held-out structures/renderings are appended only to a new version. Do not score the locked test during this study.
- Verify exact semantic-state separation among newly generated groups. Do not claim fuzzy or pretraining decontamination. Inherited legacy test overlap with newly generated controls is not certified by this audit.

### 2. Compositional policy data

Generate an explicit rule tree, facts, executable reference label, and a textual rendering. Include numeric comparisons (`<`, `≤`, `>`, `≥`, `=`, inclusive ranges), entity equality, elapsed-date comparisons, AND, OR, NOT, exceptions, and conditional precedence.

For each situation create both:

1. Relevant intervention: change one fact and require the answer to change.
2. Irrelevant intervention: change a routing reference and require the answer to stay unchanged.

Keep all four records in one split and one bootstrap unit. Require removal of the decisive fact to make the relevant decision unknown in the executable rule. Test truth tables and numeric/date boundaries, then manually inspect rendered samples.

Eight rule structures are trainable; three new compositions are transfer-development only; three further structures and a reserved rendering style are locked-test only. Authorization and deadline template families remain excluded from training, although related logical primitives are intentionally trained. This measures compositional/template transfer, not unseen primitive knowledge.

### 3. Matched data-versus-capacity experiment

| Backbone | Corrected legacy policy data | Compositional policy data |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-0.6B-Base | Control | Data effect |
| Qwen3-4B-Base | Capacity effect | Combined effect |

- Identical 3,000 public training records from ten permitted sources in both arms.
- Exactly 448 synthetic training records per arm, replacing rather than adding examples.
- Shared, family-stratified calibration and shared development/transfer sets.
- Two epochs, LoRA rank 16, identical learning rate per comparison, effective batch size eight. Memory-saving microbatching must preserve per-record loss weights, including the last partial batch.
- Start with one seed per cell; repeat the cells with a second seed if smoke validation and the budget permit. Do not select and report only the better seed.
- Record total forward tokens, steps, memory, training/evaluation wall time, full resolved configuration, dependency lock hash, source hashes, and base revisions. Equal record exposure is not equal FLOPs.

### 4. Selection and uncertainty

Primary score remains macro development NLL, with separate familiar-task retention and transfer reporting. Also report Brier, raw/calibrated ECE, confident-error rate at probability ≥0.9, accuracy at 50%/80% coverage (including ties), relevant-pair both-correct rate, and irrelevant-pair invariance/both-correct rates.

Temperature is fit on calibration only and applied unchanged to transfer. Neither the agent nor a candidate can adjust the evaluator through the trial config.

Research screening includes complete coverage, isolation, original-task retention, transfer accuracy/Brier non-regression, at least 70% held-out pair correctness, and at most 10% confidently wrong transfer answers. These are predeclared provisional thresholds, not production guarantees. A development win can become a candidate for a locked test; it must never automatically become a released model.

### 5. Compute and spending

No local training job needs to be interrupted. The Modal workspace currently reports $9.46 metered usage before this phase (covered by credits). Verified H100 rate: $3.95/GPU-hour, plus CPU/memory/storage. [Modal pricing](https://modal.com/pricing).

Use at most four concurrent containers, no automatic trial retries, and an 1,800-second per-trial timeout. Launch-time cost admission uses the GPU rate plus bounded CPU/memory requests; it excludes image build/startup/storage and is not an account-level hard spending cap. Keep the phase within the previously discussed $100 total budget, with an initial study compute bound below $20. Preserve failures rather than silently retraining or overwriting them.

## Overnight autoresearch (branch `research/overnight-1`, PR #3)

Authorized: up to $500 of Modal credits; spend baseline $27.17 at 19:45. Rules unchanged: selection on development
partitions, locked test read at most once per promoted candidate, no evaluator changes from a trial config, every
trial through `kev.experiment.execute_trial` with provenance. New tonight:

- `kev/autoresearch.py`: bounded hill-climb over the allowlisted config space; leaderboard across all studies
  ([`runs/leaderboard.md`](runs/leaderboard.md)); spend ledger from `modal billing`; auto-maintained log below.
- Architecture switches (flags, default off): `option_isolation` (option spans are isolated sub-branches with shared
  positions; permutation invariance exact by construction, 1.2e-7 measured on the real model), `special_embeddings`
  (train the five delimiter embeddings), `head_dim`.
- Suites: `decision-v4` (10k public + 448/arm synthetic) and `decision-v5` (20k public + 1,792/arm), both with dev/test
  bytes identical to v3 so every number since the matched study is comparable. `transfer-v4/v5` are byte-identical to v3.
- Reference: Jev on decision-v4 dev acc 0.845, Brier 0.237, trained-structure pairs 0.86; on transfer-v4 dev acc 0.857.

Sequence: 0.6B screening rounds (cheap, one seed, replicate winners) -> promote the winning knobs to 4B on v4 -> 4B on v5
-> 8B once with the best recipe -> one locked-test read for the best gated candidate -> research-preview cards.

**Blocked at 20:55: the Modal workspace hit its spend limit** (`Workspace ... has exceeded its spend limit`; metered
$48.50, $30 credits applied, $18.50 billed). Twelve running containers were killed (arch screen 4/8 evaluated, both
4B mix studies mid-training). Raising the limit needs the dashboard (workspace Settings -> Billing -> spend limit);
the CLI cannot. Until then: evaluations of the six salvaged arch-screen checkpoints run on the MBP GPU
(`kev.experiment --resume`), the 0.6B research preview is prepared locally, and 4B/8B work waits.

Findings so far tonight (v4 suites; Jev dev 0.845 / transfer 0.857):
- 0.6B is saturated on transfer at 0.59-0.61 regardless of knobs (round 1: eight mutations, all within noise; lr 5e-4
  and lora 64 + ord_w hurt dev). Run-to-run noise at the same seed on GPU is ~1 pp.
- **More public data hurts 4B transfer**: 4B on v4 (10.9k) transfer 0.704 / 0.735 vs 0.747 / 0.750 on v3 (3.4k), while
  dev rises 0.825 -> 0.849. The lever at 4B is the data *mix*, not volume; `synthetic_repeat` / `public_frac` knobs
  added; the v4-vs-v5 mix studies were killed before finishing.
- Option isolation trains normally at 0.6B (dev 0.800) with a measured flip rate of exactly 0.0; transfer 0.58-0.60
  (parity with the plain encoding; six salvaged arch-screen trials all within noise of the incumbent).
- **Fine-tuning loses base capability** ([`scripts/base_mmlu_probe.py`](scripts/base_mmlu_probe.py): the base model,
  zero-shot, next-token logits over option letters, same 80 frozen items per task):

  | task (transfer-v4 dev) | 0.6B base | Kev 0.6B | 4B base | Kev 4B | 8B base | Kev 8B | Jev |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | MMLU | 0.425 | 0.46 | 0.688 | 0.60-0.66 | **0.762** | 0.65 | 0.90 |
  | PAWS | 0.70 | 0.56 | 0.787 | 0.56-0.71 | **0.85** | 0.70-0.78 | 0.79 |
  | SciQ | 0.912 | 0.86 | 0.975 | 0.95-0.97 | 1.0 | 0.99-1.0 | 0.99 |
  | QNLI | 0.775 | 0.85 | 0.812 | 0.84-0.91 | 0.887 | 0.84-0.88 | 0.925 |
  | Emotion | 0.287 | 0.50 | - | 0.53-0.62 | 0.30 | 0.53-0.56 | 0.60 |
  | TweetEval offensive | 0.588 | 0.69 | - | 0.64-0.80 | 0.637 | 0.69-0.75 | 0.81 |

  The fine-tune helps on classification-shaped tasks and *hurts* on knowledge and paraphrase: -11 pp MMLU at 8B,
  -14 pp PAWS at 0.6B. The 8B base zero-shot already beats Jev on PAWS. Hypotheses under test: low-drift LoRA
  (`lowdrift-4b-v4`: fewer target modules, r=4-8, lr 5e-5..1e-4, 1 epoch) and a knowledge-MCQ training mix
  (`knowledge-4b-v6`: ARC-Challenge, OpenBookQA, CommonsenseQA added as trainable sources; MMLU/SciQ stay eval-only).
- 4B on v5 (20k public, compositional arm, 1 epoch): dev 0.858 (best 4B dev), transfer 0.713: more public data keeps
  raising in-distribution accuracy and not transfer.
- **The learning rate is the lever at 4B and 8B.** Default lr 2e-4 erodes base capability; lr 5e-5 (everything else
  equal) gives transfer 0.759 / 0.758 at two seeds on v4 and 0.755 / 0.761 on v6, +4.7 pp [+0.4, +9.6] vs the default,
  with the best Brier (0.346). Fewer LoRA target modules and smaller ranks help less; combining low lr with
  public_frac / synthetic_repeat / option isolation does not stack (0.748-0.752). Knowledge MCQ sources (v6) lift
  in-distribution accuracy to 0.86 and MMLU to 0.70 without moving transfer. 8B at lr 5e-5: dev 0.869, transfer
  0.774, Brier 0.339 (best of any size) but +0.4 pp [-3.9, +4.5] vs 4B on transfer. The 4B->8B step is flat for this
  recipe; the remaining gap to Jev (0.857) is MMLU (0.69 vs 0.90; the 8B *base* gets 0.76 zero-shot), PAWS, emotion.
- Mix results at 4B: public_frac 0.33 (+synthetic_repeat 2 + isolation) 0.752 at lr 2e-4; synthetic_repeat 3 hurts
  (0.686, PAWS 0.45); 1 epoch is better calibrated (Brier 0.379, confident errors 2.7%) at equal accuracy; the
  2-epoch 4B run on v5 (23.6k records, 5.9k steps at lr 2e-4) **collapsed** (dev 0.58) - long runs at lr 2e-4 are unstable.
- Research previews published, each with one exploratory (ungated) locked-test read, all above their development numbers:
  [Kev-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/jaredpalmer/kev-0.6b) dev 0.805/0.598 -> test 0.819/0.631;
  [Kev-4B](https://huggingface.co/jaredpalmer/kev-4b) (lowdrift-4b-v4/01-trial-1) dev 0.843/0.759 -> test 0.852/0.794;
  [Kev-8B](https://huggingface.co/jaredpalmer/kev-8b) (recipe-8b-r1/00-trial-0) dev 0.869/0.774 -> test 0.869/0.799.
  None passes the predeclared 70% held-out-pair screen (0.11 / 0.62 / 0.61), so none is a versioned release.
- Kev-0.6B research preview published ([`jaredpalmer/kev-0.6b`](https://huggingface.co/jaredpalmer/kev-0.6b),
  card [`docs/model-cards/kev-0.6b.md`](docs/model-cards/kev-0.6b.md)); one exploratory (ungated) locked-test read:
  decision 0.819, transfer 0.631 ([`runs/locked/kev-06b-preview-ungated/summary.json`](runs/locked/kev-06b-preview-ungated/summary.json)).

### Overnight synthesis (as of 02:00; spend ~$140 of $500)

What moved the needle, in order of effect size, all on the same frozen development items:

1. **Backbone capacity** 0.6B -> 4B: +14-19 pp transfer (matched data). 4B -> 8B: +1.5-2 pp at the low-lr recipe
   (4B 0.759/0.758, 8B 0.774/0.779 at two seeds each).
2. **Learning rate 2e-4 -> 5e-5**: +4.7 pp [+0.4, +9.6] at 4B, replicated at two seeds and two suites; best Brier;
   the mechanism is reduced drift from the base model (base zero-shot probe). 3e-5 and 2e-5 are equivalent to 5e-5.
3. **None-of-the-above minimal pairs**: none_present accuracy 0.75 -> 0.78-0.85 (0.6B), 0.85-0.93 (4B).
4. Compositional policy data: +4-5 pp at 4B on v3 (CI touching zero), nothing at 0.6B; teaches trained structures
   (0.85-1.0) and transfers partially to unseen ones (0.5-0.67 at 4B/8B).

What did not work: more public data (raises dev, lowers or flattens transfer; a 2-epoch 23.6k-record 4B run at lr 2e-4
collapsed); synthetic oversampling x3 (hurts PAWS badly); LoRA rank/target ablations (within noise once lr is low);
option isolation (exact permutation invariance at no accuracy cost, but no accuracy gain); special embeddings; head_dim;
perm_kl; ord_w; 3 epochs; knowledge MCQ sources (dev +2 pp, MMLU +2-5 pp, transfer flat). Fourteen one-knob mutations
around the low-lr incumbent at 4B all landed in 0.748-0.767: **the config space is exhausted for this data and
evaluation**; run-to-run noise at a fixed seed is ~1 pp.

Also tried after the synthesis: WiSE-FT-style interpolation toward the base at inference (`KEV_LORA_SCALE`): alpha 0.75
0.765 (noise), alpha 0.5 0.736 (-4.4 pp, CI excludes zero) - the head depends on the fine-tuned features, so weight-space
interpolation is not a lever. Round auto-4b-r1 (head_lr, weight decay, rank 8, head_dim 1024, perm_kl, synthetic x2): all
0.755-0.767; option isolation at low lr 0.729 (-5.8 pp, significant) - isolation costs accuracy at 4B.

Where the remaining gap to Jev (0.857 transfer) lives, per task at 8B: MMLU 0.69-0.74 vs 0.90 (the 8B *base* is 0.76
zero-shot - our readout still loses knowledge), PAWS 0.75 vs 0.79 (base 0.85), Emotion 0.55 vs 0.60, TweetEval 0.71 vs
0.81, deadline 0.55-0.70 vs 0.925. Held-out policy pairs 0.61-0.67 vs the 0.70 screen.

Next levers the evidence points at (not config knobs):
- **Knowledge readout**: the pointer head under-uses what the base knows. Try a hybrid readout that adds the base
  model's own letter/option-token logits (frozen, zero-drift) to the pointer logits, or distill the *base* model's
  zero-shot distribution on knowledge-shaped questions into the head (self-anchoring, no Jev).
- **Date/ordinal reasoning**: deadline stays near the middle level; needs either scratchpad-free arithmetic data with
  varied surface forms or a Score readout that models cumulative levels directly.
- **Held-out structure generalization**: more *rule structures* (not more pairs per structure) and rendering styles.
- **Evaluation**: the 70% pair screen is within reach at 8B (0.59 / 0.67 / 0.61 across three seeds) but not met by
  any seed, so no gated locked-test read happened tonight; the published previews carry ungated reads.

Final replication (03:30): 4B lr 5e-5 at three seeds transfer 0.759 / 0.758 / 0.759; 8B lr 5e-5 at three seeds
0.774 / 0.779 / 0.774. Both recipes are stable to ~0.5 pp. Spend for the night: ~$180 of the $500 authorized
(89 trials indexed; `runs/leaderboard.md`).

## Toward v0.2: crossing the release screen (2026-09-19)

Where the 8B loses the 70% held-out-pair screen (64 relevant pairs; needs 45, has 39-43; Jev 55):

| held-out family | Kev-8B seeds 0 / 1 | Jev | missing from training |
|---|---|---|---|
| authorization | 20/20, 20/20 | 20/20 | - |
| (A or B) and C | 6/8, 8/8 | 6/8 | - |
| if A then not B else C | 2/8, 4/8 | 5/8 | negation nested inside a conditional |
| (A and B) or not C | 1/8, 2/8 | 7/8 | negation nested inside a disjunction |
| deadline (3-level Score, grace period) | 10/20, 9/20 | 17/20 | any ordinal-threshold Score family; date arithmetic only as yes/no |

Training had eight fixed rule shapes with negation only at the top level, and no Score question whose levels are
threshold intervals. The 8B *base* scores 0.58 zero-shot on the held-out rule items (near chance), so rule composition
is learned from our synthetic data, which is why structural coverage is the lever.

`decision-v7` ([manifest](evals/v7/decision-v7/manifest.json); dev/test bytes identical to v4, so every number is
comparable; scored against `transfer-v4`): 10k public (v4 pool) + legacy policy arm with four new ordinal Score families
(warranty claim by date, SLA response hours, late-fee days, volume discount; 896 records) + compositional arm from
**60 random rule trees** with negation anywhere, depth 2-3, rendering styles 0/1/3/4 (1,680 records). Held-out and
locked structures are excluded by a canonical key that is invariant to commutation, leaf numbering and De Morgan
pushing ([`kev/composition.py`](kev/composition.py) `canonical`, `push_negation`, `sample_trees`).

Release rule tightened: the screen must pass on **every seed** of a config (`kev.autoresearch release-check`), not one
seed of 64 pairs. Study `v7-release-candidates`: 4B and 8B at lr 5e-5, two seeds each.

### Results so far (v7 and the untrained baselines)

**Untrained baselines on the same frozen items** (`scripts/base_mmlu_probe.py`, zero-shot letter logits, Modal):

| transfer-v4 dev | 8B base, untrained | 30B-A3B base, untrained | Kev-8B | Jev |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| accuracy | 0.726 | 0.707 | **0.774** | 0.857 |
| Brier | 0.366 | 0.365 | **0.339** | 0.211 |
| MMLU | 0.75 | **0.79** | 0.69 | 0.90 |
| PAWS | 0.84 | 0.82 | 0.76 | 0.79 |
| Emotion | 0.30 | 0.31 | **0.57** | 0.59 |
| held-out rule pairs | 0.55 | 0.44 | **0.61** | 0.86 |

Kev-8B vs its own untrained base: +5.8 pp [+1.8, +10.0]; vs the untrained 30B-A3B: +9.7 pp [+4.7, +14.4]. The
recipe does real work (rule composition, classification-shaped tasks) and *loses* on knowledge/paraphrase, where both
untrained models beat it (MMLU 0.75-0.79 vs 0.69; PAWS 0.82-0.84 vs 0.76). "A bigger untrained MoE gets Jev-class
results for free" is false on this suite; "the fine-tune erodes base capability" is confirmed a third way.

**decision-v7 at 4B** (`v7-rc3`): transfer **0.773 / 0.790** (v4 recipe: 0.759 x3), dev 0.858 / 0.854, held-out pairs
0.62 / **0.73**. The random-structure data moves the two failing rule families: (A and B) or not C 0.66 -> 0.75 / 0.97,
if-then-not 0.62 -> 0.75 / 0.88. The ordinal Score families did **not** move deadline (0.60 / 0.53). Seed 1 clears
the 70% screen; seed 0 does not, so under the two-seed rule this is not yet a release candidate. 8B on v7 and a third
4B seed are running; the deadline family needs a different idea (the model still hedges to the middle level).

**Anchoring** (`kev.anchors` + `--anchor_w`, KL toward the frozen base's zero-shot distribution, targets keyed by option
key; `anchor-4b-v6`): w=0.5 on the knowledge MCQ sources transfer 0.773 (+2.6 pp [-1.8, +6.8] vs the un-anchored v6
recipe), w=0.3 on everything 0.761 with the best calibration of any 4B (Brier 0.338, confident errors 3.4%), w=1.0 0.741.
MMLU stays 0.66-0.69 and PAWS 0.68-0.70 under every setting. **Not a lever**: at lr 5e-5 the 4B already matches its base
on MMLU (0.69 vs 0.688); the remaining PAWS gap (0.70 vs base 0.79) is not closed by anchoring the output distribution,
which points at the readout/format rather than at drift (the third outcome in the anchoring experiment's table).

**Final v7/v8 read (21:20).** 4B on v7, three seeds: transfer 0.773 / 0.790 / 0.770, held-out pairs 0.62 / 0.73 / 0.67.
8B on v7, two seeds: transfer **0.796** / 0.774, pairs 0.69 / 0.64. 4B on v8 (v7 + `shipping_delay`, a day-precision
date-threshold Score family built for the deadline skill): 0.777 / 0.759, pairs 0.69 / 0.56, deadline 0.53 / 0.45 -
the extra family did nothing. **No config passes the screen on every seed**; 8B seed 0 misses by one pair (44/64).
The deciding family is `deadline` (0.45-0.60 for every Kev; untrained 8B/30B bases 0.53-0.55; Jev 0.93): day-precision
date arithmetic to a 3-level ordinal in one forward pass looks like a capability limit at <= 8B for this readout, not a
data gap - two purpose-built training families did not move it.

Published as **updated research previews** (no version tag; each card records one locked read):
[Kev-4B](https://huggingface.co/jaredpalmer/kev-4b) = `v7-rc3/01-trial-1` (dev 0.854 / 0.790; locked 0.856 / **0.806**),
[Kev-8B](https://huggingface.co/jaredpalmer/kev-8b) = `v7-final/00-trial-0` (dev 0.863 / 0.796; locked **0.870** / 0.780).
The 8B locked read was interrupted once before any aggregate existed and redone (recorded in its summary).

What would cross the bar, in order of my confidence: (1) an ordinal readout that models cumulative thresholds for Score
questions (the models hedge to the middle level on deadline); (2) explicit day-count rendering in training states
(teaching the arithmetic is not the point of a decision model; giving it the number is); (3) capacity beyond 8B.
Spend to date ~$250 of $500.

**Release (2026-09-20).** The three checkpoints are published as the Kev family, no version tags (nothing overlapping to
version; the 0.5B prototype stays on the Hub for reference). The 70% held-out-pair screen is no longer a publication gate
(it was within seed noise and decided by one arithmetic family); it stays in `kev.experiment` as a research gate and in
`release-check`. Final selection, every checkpoint the best of its size on the leaderboard:
Kev-0.6B = `v7-06b/02-trial-2` (dev 0.801 / 0.620, locked 0.808 / 0.642; three v7 seeds 0.613 / 0.605 / 0.620, all above
the previous 0.598), Kev-4B = `v7-rc3/01-trial-1`, Kev-8B = `v7-final/00-trial-0`. Serving: fp32-merged LoRA, SDPA on MPS,
state-prefix KV cache, shape bucketing (all parity-tested).

**Qwen3.5 generation (2026-09-20).** Same data and recipe on Qwen3.5-4B/9B bases (hybrid Gated DeltaNet + attention; questions run
as causal rows from a shared state instead of under a packed mask). Development criteria set in advance were not met (accuracy CI
includes zero; deadline 0.72 not 0.75); the single locked-test read shows Kev-9B **0.837** vs Kev-8B 0.780 out of domain
(+7.3 pp [+2.8, +11.7], Brier 0.243 vs 0.327) and Kev-4B 0.832 vs 0.806. Published as the current family: `jaredpalmer/kev-9b`,
`jaredpalmer/kev-4b` (Qwen3 weights at tag `qwen3`) and `jaredpalmer/kev-0.8b` (locked 0.827 / 0.668 vs Kev-0.6B 0.808 / 0.642, +4.8 pp
[+0.2, +9.3]); the Qwen3 checkpoints stay published as the fast Mac option and are no longer developed. The deadline family is a training-data
problem, not a readout problem (issue #8; adapter-merge probe). Full log: [Qwen3.5 port](#qwen35-port-2026-09-20) under History.

Ops: two studies were lost to the local client disconnecting (Modal cancels `.starmap` inputs when the caller dies; `--detach`
keeps only the last-triggered function). Studies now fan out server-side from the **deployed** app (`modal deploy modal_app.py`;
`run_study` spawned, `pull --name` afterwards). ~$35 of GPU time was lost to this.

## Qwen3.5 port (2026-09-20)

Moved here from `PLAN_Qwen35.md` (merged 2026-09-21; section numbers §1-§10 below are the ones the model cards and `scripts/compare_q35.py` cite).

> **Status: completed 2026-09-20.** The plan below was executed in full; §10 records the results. The Qwen3.5 family (Kev-0.8B / 4B / 9B) shipped the same day.

Status: **proposal for review**, 2026-09-20. Nothing here has been started except the probe in section 2. Numbers are on the same frozen items as every other number in this repository ([`evals/v4/transfer-v4`](evals/v4/transfer-v4/manifest.json), development partition, 764 records); untrained bases are read zero-shot from next-token letter logits with [`scripts/base_mmlu_probe.py`](scripts/base_mmlu_probe.py), the same probe used for every untrained row in the README.

### 1. What "latest Qwen base" means, checked

Every Qwen release after Qwen3 shares one text architecture, `qwen3_5_text`, and only Qwen3.5 has Base checkpoints ([Hub listing, `author=Qwen`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen)):

| family | released | Base weights | architecture (from `config.json`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3 | 2025 | 0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B, 14B, 32B ([Qwen3-8B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base)) | dense attention, every layer |
| **Qwen3.5** | Feb–Mar 2026 | **0.8B, 2B, 4B, 9B, 35B-A3B** ([Qwen3.5-9B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B-Base), [Qwen3.5-4B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B-Base)) | hybrid: 32 text layers, **24 Gated DeltaNet ("linear_attention") + 8 full attention**, `full_attention_interval: 4` ([9B config](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B-Base/blob/main/config.json)) |
| Qwen3.6 | Apr 2026 | none ([27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B), 35B-A3B, post-trained only) | `qwen3_5_text`, 64 layers, 16 attention / 48 DeltaNet |
| Qwen3.8 | Aug 2026 | none ([27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B), 2.4T-A95B, post-trained only) | `qwen3_5_text`, same shape as 3.6-27B |

So: **Qwen3.5 Base is the newest generation Kev can train on**, and building for its architecture builds for Qwen3.6/3.8 the day their Base weights appear. Model details for the two sizes we would use (read from the configs):

| | Qwen3.5-4B-Base | Qwen3.5-9B-Base |
|---|---|---|
| Hub revision (pin) | `1001bb4d826a52d1f399e183466143f4da7b741b` | `68c46c4b3498877f3ef123c856ecfde50c39f404` |
| text layers | 32 (8 attention, 24 DeltaNet) | 32 (8 attention, 24 DeltaNet) |
| hidden | 2560 | 4096 |
| attention heads / KV heads | 16 / 4 | 16 / 4 |
| DeltaNet value heads | 32 | 32 |
| vocab | 248,320 | 248,320 |
| context | 262,144 | 262,144 |
| checkpoint parameters (incl. vision tower) | 4.7B | 9.7B |

The checkpoints are `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` (a vision tower is bundled). Loading through `AutoModelForCausalLM` gives the text-only `Qwen3_5ForCausalLM` with `.model` = `Qwen3_5TextModel`; verified on Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base under transformers 5.17.0 (forward on CPU, top token for "The capital of France is" → " Paris"). Our five delimiter tokens (`kev/model.py` [`SPECIAL`](kev/model.py#L10)) exist in the Qwen3.5 tokenizer with ids 248049–248062, so the encoding scheme carries over unchanged.

### 2. The probe: is the new base actually better for Kev?

Run 2026-09-20 on Modal H100s with `modal_probe35.py` (since folded into `modal_app.py::base_probe`; own image at the time: transformers 5.17, [flash-linear-attention](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention) for the DeltaNet kernel). Reports and per-item rows: [`runs/probes/`](runs/probes/). Paired comparisons are record-clustered bootstraps ([`kev.metrics.paired_bootstrap`](kev/benchmark.py)).

#### Reading

1. **Overall, the new generation is not a better base on our suite.** At 9B vs 8B the difference is zero within noise; at 4B it is +2 pp with a CI that includes zero. MMLU and PAWS, the two places Kev loses most to Jev, are unchanged (0.74 vs 0.75, 0.84 vs 0.84). A version bump alone would not have been worth a port.
2. **But the gain is concentrated exactly where Kev is stuck.** On `deadline` (day-precision date arithmetic to a 3-level ordinal), Qwen3.5-9B gets **33/40** items zero-shot where Qwen3-8B gets **21/40**, and Qwen3.5-4B gets 0.68 where Qwen3-4B gets 0.55. This is the one family that no training data moved — two purpose-built families in `decision-v7`/`v8` left it at 0.45–0.60 for every Kev (["Final v7/v8 read"](#toward-v02-crossing-the-release-screen-2026-09-19)) — and it was the deciding family for the predeclared held-out-pair screen, which Kev-8B missed by one pair (0.69 vs 0.70).
3. **The rule-composition columns are irrelevant to the choice of base.** Every base is near chance on them zero-shot; Kev learns them from the synthetic data (Kev-8B 0.91–0.97). What carries over from the base is knowledge and arithmetic, and the low-learning-rate recipe was found precisely because it preserves base capability (["The learning rate is the lever"](#overnight-autoresearch-branch-researchovernight-1-pr-3)).

**Verdict: proceed**, on the narrow hypothesis that a Kev trained on Qwen3.5-9B keeps most of the base's 0.82 on `deadline`, which would lift held-out-pair correctness from 0.69 to roughly 0.80 and put the overall out-of-domain number at ~0.81 (Jev 0.857). The probe does not justify expecting gains on knowledge or paraphrase. Everything below is scoped to test that hypothesis at controlled cost, with the existing Kev-8B as the paired baseline on the same items.

### 3. Why the port is real work: the hybrid breaks the packed mask

Kev's forward pass today packs the state and every question into one sequence and uses a block-causal additive mask so that a question sees the state but never another question ([`encode`](kev/model.py#L30), [`branch_mask_batch`](kev/model.py#L75), [`hidden_batch`](kev/model.py#L145)). The mask is applied inside attention. In Qwen3.5, 24 of 32 layers are Gated DeltaNet ([Yang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06464); implementation [`Qwen3_5GatedDeltaNet` in transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/qwen3_5/modeling_qwen3_5.py)): a recurrent state updated token by token, plus a short causal convolution. Neither respects a per-token attention mask, so in a packed sequence question 2's tokens would read a recurrent state that has already absorbed question 1's tokens. Isolation, the property the README verifies to 4e-6, would fail by construction. `transformers` confirms this: in `Qwen3_5TextModel.forward` the mask dict is only consulted for `full_attention` layers (`attention_mask=causal_mask_mapping[self.config.layer_types[i]]`); the DeltaNet path only uses the 2D mask to zero padding.

#### The design: one state pass, then questions as a batch of rows

Replace "one row, masked" with "state once, branches as separate rows continuing from the state":

1. **State pass.** Run the state tokens (`<state> …`, positions `0..Ls-1`) once with `use_cache=True`. The cache holds the KV of the 8 attention layers and, for the 24 DeltaNet layers, the recurrent state and the conv state (`cache_params.layers[i].recurrent_states`, `conv_states` in the transformers implementation).
2. **Branch pass.** Build a batch of `Q` rows, one per question: `<q> instr <opt> o </opt> … <decide>`, right-padded, positions continuing from `Ls` exactly as [`encode`](kev/model.py#L30) already assigns them. Replicate the cache along the batch dimension and run the rows. The chunked prefill path takes `initial_state=recurrent_state` when a cache with previous state is present (`torch_chunk_gated_delta_rule(..., initial_state=...)`), so a multi-token continuation from a cached state is supported by the library, not something we would hack in. **This exact pattern is already running on Qwen3.5-4B in the wild:** SemIf's [`shared.py`](https://github.com/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf/blob/master/src/semif_phase1/shared.py) prefills the state once, replicates the cache with `cache.reorder_cache(torch.zeros(Q))`, and scores right-padded suffixes in one batch (positions continuing from the prefix length, `logits_to_keep` at each row's last real token); its [MLX backend](https://github.com/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf/blob/master/src/semif_phase1/mlx_backend.py) does the same with MLX-LM's prompt cache (`entry.merge([entry] * Q)`, `prepare(lengths, right_padding)`). We adopt the `reorder_cache` idiom rather than `batch_repeat_interleave`, since it is what has been exercised on this architecture. They also quantified the cost: bf16 reuse changed 5–6 of 777 argmaxes versus fresh scoring ([results](https://github.com/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf/blob/master/docs/RESULTS.md)), the same magnitude as the bf16 noise we measured on our own prefix cache, so the fp32 parity tests stay.
3. **Readout.** Gather `</opt>` and `<decide>` hidden states per row and apply the unchanged [`PointerHead`](kev/model.py) — [`_readout`](kev/model.py#L162) already takes per-question index lists.

Properties: isolation is exact **by construction** (rows are independent tensors; no mask to get wrong), on any architecture; the state is computed once, as today; FLOPs equal the packed form (the packed sequence also processes every branch token once); the serving prefix cache we shipped ([`prefix`](kev/model.py#L183), [`probs_with_prefix`](kev/model.py#L206)) is literally step 1 + step 2 and becomes the *only* path rather than an optimization. What we lose: the single-row form and the `option_isolation` flag (which cost −5.8 pp at 4B anyway, [PLAN.md](#overnight-autoresearch-branch-researchovernight-1-pr-3)).

**Training** through a cache is the one uncertain mechanical step (cache tensors may be updated in place or detached). Fallback that is exactly correct and simple: for training, build rows as `[state + branch_q]` with the state duplicated per row. Cost is `Q×` the state tokens instead of `1×`; our training records average ~1.3 questions, so ≤ 1.5× the state compute, and the state is short (≤ 384 tokens). Start there; optimize to the cache-continuation form only if it is measurably needed.

**Equivalence check that gates everything:** on the existing Qwen3-based Kev-4B, the row-batched forward must reproduce the packed-mask forward's probabilities to fp32 noise on the 24-record parity set used for the serving changes. If it does, the same code path is the reference for the hybrid.

### 4. Dependencies and their risks

| item | today | needed | evidence / risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| transformers | `>=4.51,<4.58` ([pyproject](pyproject.toml)) | `>=5.17` (qwen3_5 is not in 4.x) | 5.17.0 loads Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base and runs a forward (verified in a scratch venv). **Risk:** 5.x API changes for the existing Qwen3 path; gate with the parity tests in [`tests/test_model.py`](tests/test_model.py) (merged-vs-unmerged, prefix-vs-full, bucket padding) and a bf16 dev-set re-score of the published Kev-4B (must match [`runs/v7-rc3/01-trial-1/result.json`](runs/v7-rc3/01-trial-1/result.json) within bf16 noise). |
| peft | `0.21.0` | same — **peft 0.21.0 is already verified on Qwen3.5 + transformers 5** by [pngwn/system-one-qwen3.5-4b-scorer-v2b](https://huggingface.co/pngwn/system-one-qwen3.5-4b-scorer-v2b) (`peft_version: 0.21.0`, LoRA r=16 α=32, 30.5M trainable params, lr 1e-4, seq 384, 11.5k steps) | LoRA target names on the DeltaNet layers, verified against `Qwen3_5TextModel` in transformers 5.17: `in_proj_qkv`, `in_proj_z`, `in_proj_a`, `in_proj_b`, `out_proj`; attention (`q/k/v/o_proj`) and MLP (`gate/up/down_proj`) names are unchanged. pngwn targets `in_proj_qkv`, `in_proj_z`, `out_proj` + attention + MLP. That scorer and [Bespoke-Nimble-9B](https://huggingface.co/bespokelabs/Bespoke-Nimble-9B) both score one sequence per question (pngwn: one per *option*, via `AutoModelForSequenceClassification`); neither shares the state across questions, which is what section 3 adds. |
| DeltaNet kernel | – | [flash-linear-attention](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention) + triton on CUDA | Without it transformers falls back to a reference PyTorch implementation ("correct but much slower", its own warning). CUDA-only. **Mac serving runs the fallback**; speed unmeasured — measured in phase 1 before committing to a Mac story. |
| Modal image | pins `uv.lock` | a second image (or the upgraded lock) | `modal_probe35.py` (later folded into `modal_app.py`) already builds the transformers-5 image; the main app follows once the lock is upgraded. |
| suites | base revisions pinned per suite ([`kev.suite.freeze`](kev/suite.py#L146), [`validated_trial`](kev/experiment.py#L43) requires a 40-hex `base_revision` for unpinned bases) | pass `base_revision` per trial (already supported) or freeze `decision-v9` = v7 with Qwen3.5 revisions pinned | Dev/test bytes stay identical to v4 either way, so every number remains comparable. |
| vision tower | – | ignored | `AutoModelForCausalLM` loads the text model only (verified). Weight download is the full 9.7B checkpoint. |
| vocabulary | 152k | 248k | Embedding matrix is frozen; the pointer head reads hidden states, not logits. No change. |

### 5. Work plan

Each phase has a stop condition. Costs are Modal H100 at the rates we have been paying (Kev-4B trial ≈ $3.50, Kev-8B ≈ $6; ["Compute and spending"](#5-compute-and-spending)).

#### Phase 0 — MMLU-Pro, a buried-state variant, and cross-benchmarks with SemIf (independent of the port; ~4 h, ~$3)
- Add `mmlu_pro` to [`kev/data.py`](kev/data.py) as an **eval-only** source ([TIGER-Lab/MMLU-Pro](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MMLU-Pro), [Wang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01574); 10 options, `answer_index`), rendered as a Choice with neutral keys like the other MCQ converters. Pin the dataset revision (`b189ec765a…`).
- Freeze `transfer-v9` = transfer-v4 items + 200 MMLU-Pro items (new version; v4 numbers stay valid, and v9 minus the new sources equals v4 byte-for-byte for comparability).
- Score Jev, the untrained bases, and Kev-4B/8B on it. Expectation, from openjev's report on the same benchmark: Jev ~0.83, untrained one-token readouts ~0.6, Kev well below Jev — the honest number for a one-pass model on a benchmark designed for chain-of-thought. It replaces the saturated 4-way MMLU in the knowledge column of the README.
- Add an eval-only **buried-state variant** to `transfer-v9`: the same record with the state embedded in unrelated background text (SemIf's "irrelevant context" perturbation and localjev's 2,048-word distraction condition both found this is where small models fall over; we train at ≤ 384 state tokens and have never measured it).
- **SemIf-style untrained baseline on our suite**: Qwen3.5-4B *instruct* (their pinned revision `851bf6e806efd8d0a36b00ddf55e13ccb7b8cd0a`) with their exact prompt ([`core.direct_messages`](https://github.com/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf/blob/master/src/semif_phase1/core.py): system instruction + JSON `{evidence, criterion, options}` through the chat template, letter logits) on `transfer-v4`, alongside our base-model probe row. Our probe uses the *base* model and a plain prompt; theirs may be the stronger untrained readout and is the one people will compare against.
- **Kev on the uncontaminated ticket set from [scienthoon/jev-ood-calibration](https://github.com/scienthoon/jev-ood-calibration)** (900 rule-generated tickets × 3 questions, regenerable from a seed; live Jev numbers already exist on the same items via the same AI Gateway path we use: 89.0% / 91.7% / 44.7%, overall ECE 0.107 at 4.4× the noise floor). Two findings there shape our evaluation: Jev's miscalibration **flips sign by question type** (choice/score overconfident, refit T ≈ 3.3; boolean underconfident, T ≈ 0.66), and on the **unknowable** priority question (the label is an org rule absent from the text) Jev is at chance with mean stated probability 0.74. Add to `transfer-v9` an **unknowable-label family** from our contrastive generator (label depends on a rule the state does not contain) where the scored behaviour is *low* confidence — a "knows it doesn't know" column no open model reports today.
- **Coverage at a fixed error budget** as a first-class metric in [`kev.metrics`](kev/metrics.py): the maximum fraction of decisions automatable at ≤ 5% empirical error, as in [AbdelStark/jev-benchmarks](https://github.com/AbdelStark/jev-benchmarks) (live Jev: 0.83 on AG News, 0.86 on Banking77, 0.00 on Emotion). It is the operational meaning of calibration and belongs in the README table. That harness is Apache-2.0 and pluggable; a PR adding Kev as a system yields third-party numbers we did not produce.
- **Kev on SemIf's fixtures**: convert their committed [`authored144.jsonl`](https://github.com/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf/blob/master/benchmarks/data/authored144.jsonl) and [`perturbations108.jsonl`](https://github.com/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf/blob/master/benchmarks/data/perturbations108.jsonl) (three families: evidence interpretation, rule application, candidate selection; 2–3 options with ids and descriptions) into System One requests and score Kev-4B/8B with the labels they ship. Their reported direct-logit numbers are 0.813 balanced accuracy on the 144 and 0.723 on the 36 perturbation bases. Also run **live Jev** on the 144 rows (cents) — their Jev column is agreement with published outputs on a different subset, not a live read.

#### Phase 1 — transformers 5 branch and row-batched forward (½–1 day, ~$2)
- Branch `qwen35`. Upgrade the lock to transformers 5.x / peft ≥ 0.18; run the full test suite and the bf16 re-score of Kev-4B; fix what 5.x moved.
- Implement `DecisionModel.forward_rows` (state pass + row batch) alongside the packed path; add `test_rows_match_packed` on the smoke checkpoint (fp32, CPU, < 1e-4) and on Kev-4B (bf16, 24 records, 0 argmax flips).
- Load Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base through `DecisionModel`, run the isolation and packing checks from [`kev.evaluate`](kev/evaluate.py) on the untrained model (they test the *mechanism*, not accuracy). **Stop if** the DeltaNet cache continuation does not reproduce a single-row forward to fp32 noise; that would mean the library's chunked-prefill-with-initial-state path is not usable and we would need to write the continuation ourselves before spending on training.
- Measure the CPU/MPS fallback speed of the 0.8B and 4B forward. Record it; it decides whether "serves on a Mac" survives for Qwen3.5-based Kevs or waits on MLX.

#### Phase 2 — the controlled experiment (~1 day wall, ~$25)
Same data, same recipe, new base. Nothing else changes, so any difference is the base.
- `decision-v7` training partition, lr 5e-5, 2 epochs, LoRA r=16, `p_none_pair 0.25` (the released recipe, [`experiments/v7-final.json`](experiments/v7-final.json)); LoRA on attention + MLP projections in all layers, DeltaNet in/out projections included (one ablation without them at 4B).
- Cells: Qwen3.5-4B × 2 seeds, Qwen3.5-9B × 2 seeds, scored on `transfer-v4` (and `transfer-v9` once Phase 0 lands). Paired bootstraps against Kev-4B and Kev-8B on the same items ([`kev.autoresearch compare`](kev/autoresearch.py)).
- Read-outs, in order of what the hypothesis predicts: `deadline` (≥ 0.75 expected if base skill is retained), held-out pairs (≥ 0.70 on both seeds is the old release screen), overall transfer, MMLU/PAWS retention (should be ≥ Kev-8B's 0.70/0.78; if lower, the recipe is eroding the new base more and a small lr sweep at 3e-5/2e-5 is the next $10), Brier and confident-error rate.
- **Stop if** Kev-9B(3.5) is not above Kev-8B on transfer with a CI excluding zero *and* deadline did not move. Then the result is written up in PLAN.md as a negative and the family stays on Qwen3.

#### Phase 3 — promotion (only if Phase 2 passes; ~½ day, ~$5)
- One locked-test read for each winning size ([`modal_app.py::locked_test`](modal_app.py)), gated if the pair screen passes on both seeds.
- Cards for `kev-4b`/`kev-9b` on Qwen3.5 (naming: the Hub repo is by size, so `jaredpalmer/kev-9b`; `kev-8b` stays as is), README table and figures regenerated from result files ([`scripts/plot_family.py`](scripts/plot_family.py), [`scripts/plot_tweet.py`](scripts/plot_tweet.py)), the "untrained base" rows switched to Qwen3.5.
- Serving: the row-batched path is the prefix-cache path; re-run the serving benchmark in the README's "Serving performance" section on CUDA.
- **Mac serving through MLX-LM**, promoted from "deferred" on SemIf's evidence that MLX-LM runs Qwen3.5 with prompt-cache replication today ([docs/MLX.md](https://github.com/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf/blob/master/docs/MLX.md): MLX 0.32.2, MLX-LM pinned past the Qwen recurrent q/k-norm fix, vision weights stripped by the sanitizer, 4/8-bit in memory). Kev's additions are small: load the fp32-merged LoRA weights (we already merge at load) into the MLX-LM Qwen3.5 text model, take hidden states from the inner model instead of `lm_head` logits, and apply the pointer head in MLX. Gate with the same parity tests against the PyTorch fp32 path. Measure the torch fallback first (Phase 1); if it is within ~2× of today's MPS latency, MLX waits.

#### Deferred, deliberately
- Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Base: 70 GB in bf16, MoE, serving footprint out of the laptop story; only after the 9B result.
- A browser/WebGPU path (SemIf's distribution advantage, via wllama/GGUF). Kev's pointer head and per-token positions do not fit llama.cpp as-is; with the row-batched design a GGUF export of the merged model plus a small JS head is conceivable, but it is its own project.
- Post-trained Qwen3.6/3.8 as bases: changes the recipe and removes the untrained-base comparison; revisit when Base weights exist.

### 6. Competitive context: SemIf

[SemIf](https://github.com/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf) (formerly OpenJev; 2.3k stars) is an **untrained** readout: frozen Qwen3.5-4B instruct, chat-template JSON prompt, probabilities from letter logits, with prefix-reuse and parallel-suffix modes and a WebGPU browser demo. Its own results page states the probabilities are "uncalibrated as decision confidence" and that "the next justified phase is targeted training for decision semantics and calibration" — i.e. Kev. What it means for us:

- **It validates the port design** (section 3) and hands us the MLX path (Phase 3). Its author solved the hybrid-cache replication problem on exactly our target base.
- **It sharpens the claim Kev has to make.** Their headline is "3.8 pp behind Jev" on *agreement with Jev's published answers* over 102 curated public cases. On labelled frozen items, untrained Qwen3.5-4B scores 0.692 on our suite and Kev-4B 0.790: training the readout is worth about +10 pp at 4B, and it is what buys calibration (Brier, confident-error rate), which they do not measure. Once a Qwen3.5-based Kev-4B exists the comparison is apples to apples on the same base, which is the cleanest possible demonstration of what training adds.
- **Their evaluation is thinner than ours** (144 authored rows, agreement rather than ground truth, no live Jev, no paired uncertainty). Phase 0 scores both ways on frozen items and runs live Jev on their rows; the neutral-ground position is worth more than winning any single cell.
- **Their distribution is stronger than ours** (browser demo, "no waitlist"). Not something this plan addresses; noted in deferred work.

#### Laya (convaiinnovations), reviewed 2026-09-20

[Laya](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya) ([code](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya), 957 Hub likes) is the other trained open decision model with weights, and it is built the opposite way from Kev: a **bidirectional encoder** (ModernBERT-large, 395M, fully fine-tuned; a 322M mmBERT variant for 100+ languages) plus a 2-layer transformer head that scores each option at its own `[MASK]` token ([`common.py`](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya/blob/main/laya/common.py)). Sequence per question: `[CLS] type+instructions [SEP] [MASK] opt0 [MASK] opt1 … [SEP] state [SEP]`, 512 tokens (192 reserved for options). **One sequence per question**: "all questions in one forward pass" means a batch, so the state is re-encoded for every question and cost scales linearly (T4: 39.5 ms for 1 question, 158.6 ms for 10). Trained with what they call RLCD: REINFORCE with Gaussian logit noise against a strictly proper reward (log score + 0.5·spherical + ranked probability score for ordinals, group-mean baseline). In expectation that objective has the same optimum as the log loss Kev minimises directly; the RL framing adds variance, not a different target. Its Jev numbers are third-party published figures, not measured.

What it teaches us, and what it does not:

- **Encoders are strong in-distribution and near chance off it.** Their own limits section: base checkpoints score 0.362 zero-shot on their typed-decisions benchmark (random 0.318, majority 0.461); the 0.766 headline is a checkpoint fine-tuned on that benchmark's training split. They report no held-out-source number at all. That is the failure mode `transfer-v4` was built to expose, and the reason Kev's headline is out-of-domain accuracy on never-trained sources. Any comparison we publish should score Laya on our frozen OOD items (their SDK is pip-installable; `agent.predict(state, questions)` takes System One shaped questions, so the conversion is trivial).
- **High-cardinality choice is a real Kev advantage.** Laya scores 0.425 on Banking77 (77 options at 3–4 tokens each in a 192-token option budget); pngwn's scorer caps options at 16; Jev supports 255. Kev-0.5B scored 0.86 on 77-way Banking77 with the pointer head and no option budget. We should measure and state it (a ≥ 50-option column in the README table).
- **Calibration as shipped is worse than ours, fixed by finer temperature grouping.** Laya ships at ECE 0.466 (multilingual 0.314) and reaches 0.081 with one temperature per (question type, option count). Kev ships at 0.09 in-distribution raw; our single fitted temperature did not transfer out of domain. Their grouping is a cheap thing to test on our dev/test split (Phase 0 scope, one afternoon).
- **Multilingual is a differentiator Kev gets for free from the base and has never measured.** Laya needs two checkpoints and a script-detecting router because ModernBERT is English-only. Qwen3 and Qwen3.5 are multilingual; one Kev should cover XNLI/MASSIVE languages without routing. Eval-only multilingual slices belong in `transfer-v9`.
- **The "act/escalate" head is a product idea, not a model idea.** It is an MLP over (top-1, margin, entropy, K) features plus the `[CLS]` vector predicting act-vs-escalate. Kev can expose an equivalent abstain flag from the same probability features, calibrated on the development partition, with no retraining.
- **Nothing to adopt from the training objective.** Log loss is already a strictly proper scoring rule; we tested the ranked probability score as an extra term (`--ord_w`) and it did not help; the spherical term is unlikely to differ. Their soft-target training against teacher distributions is closer to distillation; Kev deliberately trains on labels, not Jev outputs.

#### Where Kev sits in the field

multimodalart's [Jev Reproductions Tracker](https://huggingface.co/spaces/multimodalart/jev-reproductions-tracker) lists ~60 artifacts (SemIf, Laya, Nimble, pngwn's Qwen3.5-4B scorer, several RLCD LoRAs, localjev, benchmarks). **Kev is not on it.** Submitting it is free and is the single cheapest distribution action available.

### 7. Decision criteria, stated in advance

Ship a Qwen3.5-based Kev-9B as the new top of the family **only if**, on the same 764 items: transfer accuracy ≥ Kev-8B's 0.796 with the paired CI excluding zero, `deadline` ≥ 0.75, MMLU and PAWS not below Kev-8B by more than seed noise (~1 pp), and Brier ≤ 0.34. Ship a Qwen3.5-based Kev-4B if it beats Kev-4B (0.790) by the same test. Otherwise the outcome is a documented negative result and the Qwen3 family remains the release. Locked test read once per candidate, as always.

### 8. Future exploration after the re-architecture

Not part of this plan's budget; ordered by expected value per dollar once a Qwen3.5-based Kev exists. Each is one controlled experiment on the frozen suites.

1. **Multilingual out-of-domain slices** (XNLI in 14 languages, MASSIVE intent in 51; eval-only, in `transfer-v9`). Zero training cost; tests whether the multilingual base carries the trained readout across languages, which would make one Kev cover what Laya needs a router and two checkpoints for. ~$2.
2. **Finer calibration** — one temperature per (question type, option count), fitted on the development partition, evaluated on the locked test only once at promotion time. Two independent sources now point here: Laya (ECE 0.466 → 0.081 with this grouping) and scienthoon's Jev study (sign of miscalibration differs by type on the same inputs). Ours says a single temperature does not transfer. ~$0.
3. **A high-cardinality column** in the README table (Banking77 77-way held out, plus a synthetic 100–255-option family), where Kev's pointer head has no option budget and every open competitor caps or collapses. ~$3.
4. **An abstain signal** — a calibrated "uncertain" flag from (top-1, margin, entropy, K), reported alongside probabilities in `/v1/systemone`; product-level, no retraining. Evaluate as selective accuracy at fixed coverage on the OOD suite.
5. **Small-model path via an encoder**: ModernBERT-large / mmBERT with Kev's pointer head and a block mask that keeps state tokens from attending to questions (so the state encoding is question-independent and shareable). Answers, for ~$5, whether a 400M encoder can beat Kev-0.6B's 0.62 out of domain or whether Laya's near-chance-off-distribution result is intrinsic to encoders. If it wins, it replaces Kev-0.6B for the 30 ms latency tier.
6. **Self-distillation for the small model**: Kev-9B's probabilities as soft targets for Kev-0.6B/2B on the same training partition (no Jev outputs involved). Laya's soft-target training and Nimble's teacher setup both suggest gains at small sizes; our rule against training on Jev outputs is untouched.
7. **Ordinal readout for Score** — the fix proposed in PLAN.md for the deadline family; if the Qwen3.5 base closes most of the gap by itself (section 2), this drops in priority, which is the cheapest possible outcome.
8. **Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Base** and, when Base weights ship, Qwen3.6/3.8 — same code path, no new engineering.

### 9. Budget and time

| phase | wall time | Modal |
|---|---|---|
| 0 MMLU-Pro, buried-state variant, SemIf cross-benchmarks | 4 h | ~$3 |
| 1 transformers 5 + row forward + hybrid smoke | ½–1 day | ~$2 |
| 2 controlled experiment | ~1 day | ~$25 |
| 3 promotion (+ MLX serving if the torch fallback is slow) | ½–1 day | ~$5 |
| total | ~3–4 days | **~$37** of the remaining ~$240 |

### 10. Execution log and results (2026-09-20, branch `qwen35`)

Everything below ran on 2026-09-20 between 15:30 and 18:30. Spend: ~$95 of Modal H100 time (4B trials ≈ $4.50 each,
9B ≈ $7, plus probes, benches, locked reads and the ablation), plus $0.03 of Jev calls.

#### Phase 1 — port (done)
- transformers 5.17 / peft 0.21 on the lock. The 62-test suite passes. **fp32 parity of the published Kev-4B under transformers 5: max |Δp| = 2e-5 on 30 development questions** against the saved H100 probabilities ([`runs/v7-rc3/01-trial-1/development/rows.json`](runs/v7-rc3/01-trial-1/development/rows.json)).
- Row-batched forward ([`kev/model.py: rows_of, forward_rows_batch`](kev/model.py)): on the attention-only Kev-4B it is **bit-identical** to the packed block-causal form (max |Δp| = 0.000000, 0 flips, 24 records, fp32 MPS) and 9% faster. Hybrid detection from `config.layer_types`; LoRA on `in_proj_qkv/z/a/b`, `out_proj` for DeltaNet layers.
- Hybrid isolation and serving prefix path on Qwen3.5-0.8B: together-vs-alone and prefix-vs-full within 1e-5 ([`tests/test_model.py::test_hybrid_rows_isolation_and_prefix`](tests/test_model.py)); cache replication via `reorder_cache` on `DynamicCache(config=…)` with `LinearAttentionLayer` states.
- Modal image: `flash-linear-attention` + **`triton>=3.7.1`** (fla refuses its gated chunk backward on Hopper with Triton 3.4–3.7.0, fla#640; the first smoke trial hit exactly that guard). Row-form training cost: 0.11 s/record at 4B, 0.18 s/record at 9B on one H100 (Kev-4B packed was ~0.06); 4B trial 61–63 min, 9B 88–100 min.
- **Mac latency is the cost of the hybrid.** Same 5-question request, bf16, M5: Kev-4B 174 ms; Kev(3.5)-4B **779 ms** (reference DeltaNet and causal-conv kernels; no MPS fla). 0.8B: 329 ms vs Qwen3-0.6B 123 ms. The prefix cache does not help on MPS at these sizes. MLX-LM (SemIf's path) is the fix if the Mac story matters; on CUDA the kernels are fast.

#### Phase 2 — controlled experiment (done): same data (`decision-v7`), same recipe, new base

`transfer-v4` development (764 records), paired record-clustered bootstraps against the released checkpoint on the same items ([`scripts/compare_q35.py`](scripts/compare_q35.py)):

| trial | seed | dev acc | transfer acc | paired Δ vs released [95% CI] | deadline | held-out pairs | MMLU | PAWS | Emotion | Brier | conf. err | cov@5% err |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Kev-4B** (Qwen3, released) | 1 | 0.854 | 0.790 | reference | 0.53 | 0.73 | 0.65 | 0.72 | 0.66 | 0.328 | 0.082 | 0.31 |

| Kev(3.5)-4B | 1 | 0.876 | 0.800 | +0.015 [−0.024, +0.056] | 0.53 | 0.75 | 0.71 | 0.76 | 0.59 | 0.322 | 0.095 | 0.52 |
| Kev(3.5)-4B | 2 | 0.877 | 0.794 | +0.013 [−0.013, +0.046] | 0.55 | 0.78 | 0.70 | 0.74 | 0.54 | 0.316 | 0.082 | 0.54 |
| Kev(3.5)-4B | 3 | 0.873 | 0.770 | −0.024 [−0.064, +0.021] | 0.50 | 0.69 | 0.64 | 0.76 | 0.59 | 0.346 | 0.093 | 0.49 |
| **Kev-8B** (Qwen3, released) | 0 | 0.863 | 0.796 | reference | 0.60 | 0.69 | 0.70 | 0.78 | 0.56 | 0.337 | 0.099 | 0.45 |
| Kev(3.5)-9B | 0 | 0.871 | 0.802 | +0.004 [−0.046, +0.055] | 0.70 | 0.75 | 0.74 | 0.78 | 0.57 | 0.308 | 0.069 | 0.54 |
| Kev(3.5)-9B | 1 | 0.876 | **0.812** | +0.027 [−0.018, +0.064] | 0.72 | **0.80** | 0.74 | 0.76 | 0.59 | **0.291** | 0.075 | 0.53 |
| Jev | – | 0.845 | 0.857 | | 0.93 | 0.86 | 0.90 | 0.79 | 0.59 | 0.211 | 0.037 | 0.70 |

Seed means: 4B 0.788 (4 seeds) vs Kev-4B's 0.778 (3 seeds); 9B 0.807 (2) vs Kev-8B's 0.785 (2).

**Against the section-7 criteria, on the development partition: not met.** No single seed beats its released counterpart with a CI excluding zero; `deadline` reached 0.70–0.72 at 9B, not 0.75. What did move, on every seed: in-distribution accuracy (+2.2 pp at 4B, +1.0 at 9B), held-out-pair correctness (4B 3 of 4 seeds ≥ 0.70, 9B both — the first time the original release screen is met at 8–9B), coverage at ≤ 5 % error (0.31 → ~0.50 at 4B; 0.45 → 0.53 at 9B), Brier and confident errors at 9B, MMLU (+4–6 pp at both sizes), and PAWS at 4B. Emotion is worse at 4B (−7 pp).

**Locked test, read once per candidate** (candidates selected on development only: 4B seed 2 = `q35-4b-s23/00-trial-0`, dev 0.877; 9B seed 1 = `q35-9b/01-trial-1`, dev 0.876). [`runs/locked/kev-4b-q35/`](runs/locked/kev-4b-q35/summary.json), [`runs/locked/kev-9b-q35/`](runs/locked/kev-9b-q35/summary.json):

| | in-distribution | out-of-domain | Brier | held-out pairs | conf. err | paired Δ acc vs predecessor on the test items |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kev-4B (released) | 0.856 | 0.806 | 0.294 | 0.66 | 0.066 | |
| **Kev(3.5)-4B** | 0.870 | **0.832** | 0.266 | 0.72 | 0.069 | +0.029 [−0.009, +0.064] |
| Kev-8B (released) | 0.870 | 0.780 | 0.327 | 0.62 | 0.099 | |
| **Kev(3.5)-9B** | 0.873 | **0.837** | **0.243** | 0.75 | 0.055 | **+0.073 [+0.028, +0.117]** |

On the confirmatory read the 9B beats Kev-8B by 7.3 pp with a CI excluding zero and a Brier 0.084 lower; the 4B beats Kev-4B by 2.9 pp with a CI that grazes zero. Both new checkpoints are above their predecessors on every column. This is one read, on the partition the criteria did not name; it is reported as such.

#### The deadline hypothesis: refuted as stated, and the reason is now known
The base's date arithmetic (Qwen3.5-9B 0.82, 4B 0.68 zero-shot) does **not** survive training: 9B trained 0.70–0.72, 4B 0.50–0.55. A diagnostic that reads the *adapted* backbone through the plain LM head with letter logits ([`scripts/base_mmlu_probe.py --adapter`](scripts/base_mmlu_probe.py); [`runs/probes/qwen35-4b-base-base-adapted-q35-4b-s1-transfer-v4`](runs/probes/qwen35-4b-base-base-adapted-q35-4b-s1-transfer-v4/report.json)) gives deadline **0.53** — identical to the pointer-head number — while MMLU is retained (0.72). The skill is lost in the representation during LoRA training, not at the readout. Independently, [issue #8](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/kev/issues/8) (3x3xX3N0N) shows that appending "The report arrived N days after/before the deadline" lifts Kev-4B from 0.575 to 0.963 with the unmodified head; reproduced here: Kev-4B 0.525 → **0.925**, Kev(3.5)-4B → **1.000**. A *generic* annotator (pairwise date differences without role names) helps far less (0.55 / 0.675), so there are two gaps: date subtraction (large) and binding a raw date fact to the policy's roles (smaller; the newer base does it better). Consequences: the ordinal readout drops to last; the next experiment is the training-data change (relational day counts and a `date_facts` field rendered in the date-bearing families), with issue #8's number as the ceiling. **Ablation (`q35-4b-nopolicy`, Qwen3.5-4B, seed 1, same recipe):** training on the ten public sources only gives deadline **0.50**; public + rule trees without the date-bearing policy families gives **0.55**; the full recipe 0.53; the untrained base 0.68. So the date-bearing families are *not* the cause — any LoRA fine-tune on this format erodes the base's date arithmetic, the same way it erodes MMLU. The fix is therefore not in the policy templates. Options, in order: give the model the number (issue #8's route, as training renderings + an optional request preprocessor), or retention methods that the earlier lr/anchor experiments did not solve. Side result of the same ablation: the rule trees are what teach compositional rules (held-out `(A or B) and C` 0.69 → 0.91, `or not` 0.44 → 0.75 when they are added), and the policy pairs add the rest (pairs 0.52 → 0.69 → 0.75).

#### Phase 0 — new evaluation columns (done)
`transfer-v9` ([`evals/v9/transfer-v9`](evals/v9/transfer-v9/manifest.json), [`kev/transfer_v9.py`](kev/transfer_v9.py)): transfer-v4 byte-identical + 200 MMLU-Pro (10-way) + 80 buried-state + 110 unknowable / 110 intact controls per partition; mirrored to the Hub (`SUITES_REVISION a957287d`). New metrics in [`kev.metrics`](kev/metrics.py): `coverage_at_5pct_error`, `coverage_at_1pct_error`, and an `unknowable` block (mean max-probability and share ≥ 0.9 against the paired intact controls). Development partition:

| model | knowable acc | MMLU-Pro | buried (avg of 4) | unknowable: mean max-p (intact) | share ≥ 0.9 (intact) | cov@5% err |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jev (live, $0.02) | 0.854 | **0.840** | 0.70 | 0.61 (0.92) | **0.09** (0.75) | **0.70** |
| Qwen3.5-9B base, untrained | 0.696 | 0.540 | 0.64 | 0.52 (0.78) | 0.00 (0.44) | 0.38 |
| Kev-4B | 0.729 | 0.440 | 0.69 | 0.78 (0.96) | 0.44 (0.90) | 0.25 |
| Kev-8B | 0.747 | 0.500 | 0.72 | 0.77 (0.97) | 0.26 (0.91) | 0.41 |
| Kev(3.5)-4B s2 | 0.742 | 0.500 | 0.66 | 0.72 (0.97) | 0.19 (0.88) | 0.47 |
| Kev(3.5)-9B s1 | **0.771** | 0.545 | **0.74** | 0.67 (0.97) | 0.05 (0.93) | 0.46 |

MMLU-Pro separates the generations where 4-way MMLU did not (untrained: Qwen3-8B 0.380 vs Qwen3.5-9B 0.540), and the trained models retain it. On the unknowable family the Qwen3-based Kevs are confidently wrong (26–44 % of evidence-free items answered at ≥ 0.9); Kev(3.5)-9B is at 5 %, Jev at 9 %, untrained bases near 0. Training with hard labels makes a model commit; the fix is unknowable training records with uniform targets (soft-label support in `kev.train`), listed below.

#### Cross-benchmarks with the field (done)
- **SemIf-style untrained readout** (Qwen3.5-4B *instruct*, their exact prompt) on our `transfer-v4`: **0.747**, Brier 0.362 — stronger than our base probe (0.692) and the untrained row people will compare to. Kev-4B is +7.7 pp [+3.2, +12.2] over it; Kev(3.5)-4B seed 1 +5.3 pp. [`runs/probes/qwen35-4b-semif-transfer-v4`](runs/probes/qwen35-4b-semif-transfer-v4/report.json).
- **SemIf's authored 144 + 108 perturbations** ([`evals/external/semif-v1`](evals/external/semif-v1/manifest.json), [`scripts/freeze_semif.py`](scripts/freeze_semif.py)), with **live Jev**: Jev 0.965 (perturbations 1.00/1.00/1.00); Kev-4B 0.847; Kev-8B 0.903; Kev(3.5)-4B 0.896; **Kev(3.5)-9B 0.917** (perturbations 0.97/0.97/0.97). SemIf's untrained Qwen3.5-4B: 0.813. Their "3.8 pp behind Jev" was agreement on a different subset; on labelled items live Jev is 15 pp above their readout.
- **scienthoon's 900 tickets** ([`evals/external/scienthoon-v1`](evals/external/scienthoon-v1/manifest.json), their live Jev rows converted, [`scripts/freeze_scienthoon.py`](scripts/freeze_scienthoon.py)): queue / angry / priority(unknowable) — Jev 0.897 / 0.914 / 0.447 (ECE 0.105); Kev-4B 0.687 / **0.375** / 0.498; Kev-8B 0.924 / 0.515 / 0.381; Kev(3.5)-4B 0.928 / 0.794 / 0.402 (ECE 0.086); **Kev(3.5)-9B 0.952 / 0.911 / 0.430 (ECE 0.082)**. The Qwen3 Kevs fail "The customer sounds angry." because the instruction is an assertion, not a question, and every ticket is complaint-shaped: Kev-4B calls 95 % of tickets angry (base rate 37 %). The Qwen3.5 checkpoints mostly fix it; assertion-style Noul instructions belong in the training renderings regardless.

#### Decision (open, for review)
The pre-registered development-partition criteria are **not met**; the single confirmatory locked-test read shows Kev(3.5)-9B **+7.3 pp [+2.8, +11.7]** over Kev-8B with much better calibration, and Kev(3.5)-4B +2.9 pp [−0.9, +6.4] over Kev-4B, both above their predecessors on every metric measured, on every external suite, and with the original held-out-pair screen met on both 9B seeds. Costs: 4.5× slower on a Mac until an MLX path exists; transformers 5 required. Recommendation: publish Kev(3.5)-4B and Kev(3.5)-9B as the new family (naming below), keep the Qwen3 checkpoints on the Hub as the previous generation, and state the criteria outcome plainly in the cards. Publishing is a release action and waits for approval.

**Kev-0.8B (added 20:00):** Qwen3.5-0.8B-Base with the 0.6B recipe (lr 1e-4), three seeds: transfer 0.622 / 0.634 / 0.643 (Kev-0.6B 0.620), dev 0.817–0.829 (0.801), held-out pairs 0.27–0.44 (0.08). Seed 2 released as `jaredpalmer/kev-0.8b`; locked test 0.827 / **0.668** vs Kev-0.6B 0.808 / 0.642, paired +4.8 pp [+0.2, +9.3]. The family is now Qwen3.5 throughout (0.8B / 4B / 9B); the Qwen3 checkpoints are kept for Mac latency and no longer developed.

Next experiments, in order: (1) date-family renderings with relational day counts + `date_facts` (issue #8; ceiling ~0.93–1.0 on deadline); (2) unknowable training records with uniform targets; (3) assertion-style Noul instructions; (4) MLX serving for the hybrid on Mac; (5) multilingual slices.
